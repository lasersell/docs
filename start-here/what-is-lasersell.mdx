LaserSell is the most advanced, non-custodial automated exit engine built specifically for the Solana network. Designed for **high-frequency trading** and **sell sniping**, it is a premium software suite that provides retail traders with the infrastructure necessary to execute trades with millisecond precision.

Unlike standard decentralized exchange (DEX) interfaces or web-based trading bots, LaserSell operates as a hybrid system:

- **The Core:** A highly optimized CLI bot that runs 24/7 on your own Linux Virtual Private Server (VPS).
- **The Interface:** A LaserSell Chrome Extension that connects to your bot via a telemetry cloud to visualize data and monitor Profit/Loss (PnL) in real-time.

### What LaserSell Is Not

To understand the power of LaserSell, it is important to understand what it is not:

- **It is not a browser-based DApp:** LaserSell does not run solely in your web browser. The heavy lifting is done by your private server to ensure stability and speed.
- **It is not a custodial wallet:** We never hold your funds. LaserSell is strictly non-custodial; you retain full control over your private keys and assets at all times.
- **It is not for unstable connections:** It is not designed to run on a personal laptop or a standard home internet connection, which are prone to fluctuations and sleep modes that can cost you trades.

### Who Is LaserSell For?

LaserSell is built for serious traders who demand professional-grade performance. It is for you if:

- **You require speed:** You need to execute trades faster than public nodes or standard web interfaces allow.
- **You are ready to level up:** You are willing to set up a professional infrastructure environment (a Linux VPS and a Private RPC) to gain a competitive edge in the market.

**Specific Use Cases:**

- **High-Frequency Memecoin Traders & Deployers:** If you are navigating the volatile landscape of memecoins, LaserSell offers the automated edge needed to exit positions instantly.
- **High-Volume Traders:** This tool is engineered for active users executing **50-100+ trades per day**. It is built to handle the intensity of constant volume without performance degradation.
- **Quick-Flip Specialists:** LaserSell is **not** designed for users who buy and hold assets for the long term. It is optimized for rapid capital rotation and quick trades specifically those lasting **no longer than 5 minutes**.

### Our Mission

---

LaserSell is an automated exit engine for the Solana network. It runs in the background, detects new tokens you buy (or create), monitors your PnL in real time, and executes sells automatically when your conditions are met. Your keys stay on your machine, encrypted and under your control.

## How It Works

1. **You buy a token** on any platform (Axiom, Photon, BullX, Phantom, or anything else).
2. **LaserSell detects the buy** by monitoring your wallet on-chain.
3. **Your exit strategy runs automatically.** LaserSell evaluates take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, deadline, and sell-on-graduation conditions on every price update.
4. **The moment a condition is met, LaserSell sells.** The transaction is constructed, signed locally, and broadcast directly to the Solana network.

No manual clicks, no confirmation popups, no switching between tabs.

## What LaserSell Is Not

- **Not a buying tool.** LaserSell handles exits. You buy however you normally buy.
- **Not a custodial service.** Your private keys are encrypted on your machine. We never have access to them.
- **Not a website you connect your wallet to.** LaserSell is a local client that runs on your machine, or an SDK/API you integrate into your own application.

## Who Uses LaserSell

### Traders

If you trade memecoins on Solana, LaserSell gives you automated exits so you do not have to watch every position manually. Set your strategy once and let it run.

- Take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, deadline timeout, and sell-on-graduation all run in parallel.
- Adjust settings on the fly through the TUI while trades are active.
- Works with any entry method. Buy on Axiom, Photon, BullX, Terminal, or directly through Phantom.

### Deployers

If you launch tokens using tools like RapidLaunch, Uxento, or J7 Tracker, LaserSell automates your personal exit plan so you can focus on the launch and community.

### Developers

The same exit engine that powers the LaserSell client is available through the [LaserSell SDK and API](/api/overview). Build your own trading bots, platforms, or custom strategies on top of LaserSell's real-time exit intelligence, multi-protocol support, and transaction building.

Available in [TypeScript](/api/sdk/typescript), [Python](/api/sdk/python), [Rust](/api/sdk/rust), and [Go](/api/sdk/go).

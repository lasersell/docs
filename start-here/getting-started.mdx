Welcome to LaserSell. You are about to set up the most advanced, non-custodial trading terminal for the Solana network.

Before we deploy the bot, we need to gather a few essential components. This guide will walk you through purchasing your license, understanding the infrastructure requirements, and installing the necessary tools.

## 1. Obtain Your License

LaserSell is a premium tool gated by a software license.

1. **Purchase a Subscription:** Visit our [**Whop Store**](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23) and purchase the **LaserSell Monthly** subscription (\$59.99/mo).
2. **Retrieve Your Key:**
   - Go to your [**Whop Hub**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://whop.com/hub/).
   - Click on the **LaserSell** app icon.
   - Copy your unique **License Key**. You will need this during the configuration step.

> **Note:** Your license key is bound to your wallet address upon first use. If you need to switch wallets later, you must reset the license metadata within your Whop dashboard.

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements

To run LaserSell effectively, you cannot rely on a standard home internet connection or a shared public node. The bot requires a professional environment to execute trades with millisecond precision.

You will need to prepare two things (we will guide you through setting them up in the next sections):

1. **A Private RPC Endpoint:** You need a dedicated connection to the Solana blockchain. Public nodes are too slow and rate-limited for sniping. We recommend **Helius** or a dedicated private node.
2. **A Linux VPS (Virtual Private Server):** The bot must run 24/7 with ultra-low latency to the RPC node. Running it on your personal laptop is **not recommended** due to internet fluctuations and sleep modes.

_Don't have these yet? Don't worry. The next pages in this "Start Here" section will guide you through purchasing and configuring them._

## 3. Install the Chrome Extension

While the bot runs on your server (VPS), you will monitor it from your browser.

The **LaserSell Chrome Extension** is your command center. It connects to your bot via our telemetry cloud to show you real-time graphs, Profit/Loss (PnL) updates, and trade logs.

- [**Download from Chrome Web Store**](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23)

**Installation:**

1. Click the link above and add the extension to Chrome.
2. Pin the LaserSell icon to your toolbar for easy access.
3. Once your bot is running on the VPS, you will generate a **Pairing Code** to link the extension to your bot.

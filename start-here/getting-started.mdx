Welcome to LaserSell. You are about to set up the most advanced, non-custodial trading terminal for the Solana network.

Before we deploy the bot, we need to gather a few essential components. This guide will walk you through purchasing your license, understanding the infrastructure requirements, and installing the necessary tools.

## 1. Obtain Your License

LaserSell is a premium tool gated by a software license.

1. **Create your LaserSell Account**

   To access the software and manage your license, you need a LaserSell account.
   - Navigate to [**app.lasersell.io**](http://app.lasersell.io).
   - Click **Sign up** to create your new account.
2. **Purchase a Subscription**

   Once you are logged in, the dashboard will prompt you to select a plan if you do not already have an active license.
   1. **Choose a Plan**: Select the subscription cadence that works best for you:
      - **Monthly**: \$59.99/month
      - **Annual**: \$299/year
   2. **Secure Checkout**:
      - When you select a plan, a secure checkout window powered by **Whop** will appear.
      - **Note**: Whop is used securely for payment processing only. Your license key and subscription settings are managed directly within the LaserSell Dashboard.
1. **Retrieve your License Key**

   After your payment is processed, your dashboard will automatically update to display your license information.
   - Locate the **License Key** card on your dashboard.
   - Your unique key is displayed here. You can click the **Copy** button to save it to your clipboard.
   - You can also rotate your key or manage your bound wallet directly from this dashboard at any time.
2. **Next Steps**

   Now that you have your license key, you are ready to activate the LaserSell software.

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements

To run LaserSell effectively, you cannot rely on a standard home internet connection or a shared public node. The bot requires a professional environment to execute trades with millisecond precision.

You will need to prepare two things (we will guide you through setting them up in the next sections):

1. **A Private RPC Endpoint:** You need a dedicated connection to the Solana blockchain. Public nodes are too slow and rate-limited for sniping. We recommend **Helius** or a dedicated private node.
2. **A Linux VPS (Virtual Private Server):** The bot must run 24/7 with ultra-low latency to the RPC node. Running it on your personal laptop is **not recommended** due to internet fluctuations and sleep modes.

_Don't have these yet? Don't worry. The next pages in this "Start Here" section will guide you through purchasing and configuring them._

## 3. Install the Chrome Extension

While the bot runs on your server (VPS), you will monitor it from your browser.

The **LaserSell Chrome Extension** is your command center. It connects to your bot via our telemetry cloud to show you real-time graphs, Profit/Loss (PnL) updates, and trade logs.

- [**Download from Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lasersell/llablajedejfnhljgakfahpiibmbkpbl)

**Installation:**

1. Click the link above and add the extension to Chrome.
2. Pin the LaserSell icon to your toolbar for easy access.
3. Once your bot is running on the VPS, you will generate a **Pairing Code** to link the extension to your bot.

Welcome to LaserSell. 

Before we deploy the bot, we need to gather a few essential components. This guide will walk you through purchasing your license, understanding the infrastructure requirements, and installing the necessary tools.

## 1. Obtain Your License

LaserSell is a premium tool accessible via a time-limited license key. We prioritize speed and privacy, so no account creation is required.

### **Purchase an Access Pass**

To use the software, you must purchase a 7-day or 30-day access pass.

1. Navigate to [**lasersell.io/buy**.](http://lasersell.io/buy)
2. Click **Buy with Crypto**.
3. **Secure Checkout:** A Coinbase Commerce window will appear.
   - **Payment Methods:** SOL, USDC, ETH, or BTC.
   - **Important:** You must enter a valid **Email Address** during checkout. This is where your license key will be sent.

### **Retrieve your License Key**

Once your payment is confirmed on the blockchain (usually within seconds):

1. Check your email inbox for a message from **LaserSell**.
2. Your unique **License Key** (starts with `LS-`) will be inside.
3. Copy this key; you will need it to activate the bot.

### **Renewing Access**

Your key is valid for exactly 30 days. To renew:

1. Simply visit the website and purchase a new pass.
2. Your license key will be topped off with additional days.

   > _Note: We will send you an email reminder 5 days before your key expires._

## 2. Infrastructure Requirements

To run LaserSell effectively, you cannot rely on a standard home internet connection or a shared public node. The bot requires a professional environment to execute trades with millisecond precision.

You will need to prepare two things (we will guide you through setting them up in the next sections):

1. **A Private RPC Endpoint:** You need a dedicated connection to the Solana blockchain. Public nodes are too slow and rate-limited. We recommend **Helius** or a dedicated private node.
2. **A Linux VPS (Virtual Private Server):** The bot must run with ultra-low latency to the RPC node. Running it on your personal laptop is **not recommended** due to internet fluctuations and sleep modes.

_Don't have these yet? Don't worry. The next pages in this "Start Here" section will guide you through purchasing and configuring them._

## 3. Install the Chrome Extension

While the bot runs on your server (VPS), you will monitor it from your browser.

The **LaserSell Chrome Extension** is your command center. It connects to your bot via our telemetry cloud to show you real-time graphs, Profit/Loss (PnL) updates, and trade logs.

- [**Download from Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lasersell/llablajedejfnhljgakfahpiibmbkpbl)

**Installation:**

1. Click the link above and add the extension to Chrome.
2. Pin the LaserSell icon to your toolbar for easy access.
3. Once your bot is running on the VPS, you will generate a **Pairing Code** to link the extension to your bot.

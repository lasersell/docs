title: "Choosing A Private RPC"
description: "Maximize your transaction speed and success rate by selecting the right high-performance RPC node provider."
---

In high-frequency trading, your connection to the blockchain is the single most critical factor determining your success. LaserSell connects to the Solana network via a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Node**.

While Solana offers a public mainnet endpoint, **it is effectively unusable for automated trading.**

## Why a Private RPC is Required

LaserSell relies on real-time data streams to detect new liquidity pools the instant they are created. Using the public Solana RPC acts as a bottleneck that will cause you to miss every profitable trade.

### 1. Speed & Latency (The "Snipe" Factor)

- **Public RPC:** Heavily congested. By the time the public node tells your bot "a new token launched," the price has already pumped 200%.
- **Private RPC:** LaserSell uses **WebSockets (WSS)** to listen for on-chain events in milliseconds. A private provider ensures you receive these notifications faster than the general public, allowing you to buy in the same block as the developer.

### 2. Rate Limits (Avoiding "429 Too Many Requests")

- **Public RPC:** Solana caps public traffic aggressively. If LaserSell tries to check a price and submit a buy order in rapid succession, the public node will block your IP address (Error 429), leaving your bot stuck while the market moves against you.
- **Private RPC:** Paid plans offer guaranteed **Requests Per Second (RPS)**. This allows LaserSell to spam transaction retries and poll prices continuously without being banned.

### 3. Transaction Propagation

- **Public RPC:** Your "Buy" transaction enters a slow, crowded queue.
- **Private RPC:** Providers like Helius and QuickNode have direct lines to validators (stake-weighted connections). This means your transaction skips the line and gets confirmed on-chain faster.

## RPC Provider Comparison

We have compared the most popular Solana providers below.

- **Free Tiers** are useful for setting up LaserSell and running test simulations.
- **Paid Plans** are strongly recommended for live trading with real money.

| Provider       | Free Monthly Limit         | Rate Limit (RPS)   | WSS Support                                  | Entry-Level Paid Plan                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Public Mainnet | Unlimited (Technically)    | ~10 RPS (Unstable) | ❌ **Very Poor** (Disconnects often)          | N/A                                    |
| Helius         | **1 Million** Credits      | 10 RPS             | ✅ **Native**<br />(5 concurrent connections) | **\$49 / mo**  (10M Credits, 50 RPS)   |
| Chainstack     | **3 Million** Requests     | ~25 RPS            | ✅ **Included**                               | **\$49 / mo**  (20M Requests, 250 RPS) |
| QuickNode      | **10 Million** API Credits | 15 RPS             | ✅ **Included**                               | **\$49 / mo**  (80M Credits, 50 RPS)   |
| Alchemy        | **30 Million** CUs         | ~25 RPS            | ✅ **Included**                               | **\$49 / mo**  (Pay-as-you-go)         |

> **Note on "Credits" vs "Requests":**
>
> - **Requests (Chainstack):** 1 call = 1 request. Simple and predictable.
> - **Credits/CUs (Helius/Alchemy):** Different actions cost different amounts. A simple "get balance" might be 1 credit, but a heavy "get program accounts" scan could be 100 credits.

## Our Recommendation

### 🏆 Top Choice: Helius (Dev Plan)

We recommend Helius as the primary choice for LaserSell.

- **Why:** Helius is built exclusively for Solana. Their transaction propagation services and general infrastructure are superior for ensuring your snipe transactions land on-chain quickly.
- **Config:** LaserSell has a dedicated mode for Helius that optimizes data streaming.
- **Cost:** The \$49/month Dev Plan provides enough throughput for a standard sniper setup.

### 🥈 Alternative: Chainstack (Paid)

If you need simple, predictable billing or nodes in specific geographic locations to reduce latency, the paid Chainstack plans are an excellent alternative.

- **Why:** They offer very generous limits on their "Growth" plan (250 RPS), which is ideal if you plan to run multiple instances of the bot simultaneously.

### 🥉 The "Free Route" Strategy (Zero Cost)

For users who want to start without overhead costs, we recommend a hybrid configuration that leverages the best free tiers from two different providers.

- **Configuration:**
  - **RPC Connection:** **Helius Free Plan**. Use this strictly for the RPC configuration.
  - **Websocket Connection:** **Chainstack Free Plan**. Use this for the real-time data stream (WSS).
- **Why:** This combination avoids the limitations of using a single free provider. Helius offers superior transaction landing on their RPCs, while Chainstack provides a generous websocket connection on their free tier, ensuring you can stream market data without hitting immediate rate limits.

<Warning>
  This "Free Route" strategy should only just be used to "try it out". Free tier WebSocket connections have a tendency to stop responding and are not optimal. It's highly recommended to get a paid plan from an RPC provider like Helius and use their WebSocket servers.
</Warning>

## How to Configure

Once you have purchased a plan, you will receive an **HTTP URL** and a **WSS URL** (WebSocket).

1. Open your `config.yml` file.
2. Paste your keys into the `rpc` and `stream` sections:

```yaml
rpc:
  mode: "helius"  # or "private" if using Chainstack/QuickNode
  # If using Chainstack/Others, uncomment and paste here:
  # private_url: "https://solana-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/..."

helius:
  api_key: "YOUR_HELIUS_API_KEY"

stream:
  mode: "helius" # or "private"
  # If using Chainstack/Others, uncomment and paste here:
  # private_ws_url: "wss://solana-mainnet.core.chainstack.com/..."
```

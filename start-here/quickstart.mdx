## Prerequisites

- **RPC URL** from [Helius](https://helius.dev), [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com), or any Solana RPC provider
- **LaserSell API key** from [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io) (free)

## Install

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

Verify it worked:

```shellscript
lasersell --version
```

Need platform-specific instructions? See [Installation Overview](/installation/overview).

## Setup

Run LaserSell. The setup wizard starts automatically on first launch:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

The wizard will ask for your RPC URL, API key, wallet (create new or import existing), and a passphrase to encrypt your keystore. Select **Yes** when asked to use recommended settings.

<Warning>
There is no "forgot password." If you lose your passphrase, the keystore cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

For a detailed walkthrough of every prompt, see [Initial Setup](/onboarding/initial-setup).

## Verify

Run a health check to confirm everything is connected:

```shellscript
lasersell --smoke
```

You should see `SMOKE OK`. Then start LaserSell:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

LaserSell is now monitoring your wallet. Buy a token on any platform and LaserSell will detect it, track your PnL, and sell automatically when your strategy conditions are met.

LaserSell runs on your machine (desktop/laptop or a Linux VPS) and automatically executes sells when it detects new positions you buy. It is non-custodial: your keys stay on your machine. For live trading, a Linux VPS plus a private RPC is the recommended setup for uptime and latency.

If you are brand new, read [What Is LaserSell](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/what-is-lasersell) first.

## What you’ll do

By the end of this page, you will have:

- LaserSell installed
- A config file and encrypted wallet keystore created by the onboarding wizard
- LaserSell running and connected to your RPC and WebSocket
- Optionally, the Chrome Extension paired to your running instance

## 0) Before you start

You need three things.

### 1) Where LaserSell will run

- Desktop or laptop (fastest way to start)
- Linux VPS (recommended for live trading and uptime)

### 2) RPC and WebSocket

- Recommended: Helius (API key required)
- Alternative: Any private provider that gives both (like [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/))
  - HTTPS RPC URL
  - WSS WebSocket URL

### 3) Wallet plan

Treat LaserSell as a **hot wallet**. Only fund it with what you intend to actively trade.

- [Choosing a Private RPC](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/choosing-a-private-rpc)

## 1) Pick your runtime: Desktop vs VPS

### Option A: Desktop or laptop

Use this if you are testing or want to get running quickly.

- Choose an RPC and WebSocket
- Install LaserSell
- Run the setup wizard locally

### Option B: Linux VPS (recommended)

Use this if you want uptime and consistent latency.

- Provision a VPS (Ubuntu 22.04+ or Debian 12+)
- Choose a VPS in the same region as your RPC provider
- Install LaserSell on the VPS
- Run LaserSell inside tmux so it stays running after disconnect

See: [Setting Up the Linux VPS](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/setting-up-linux-vps)

## 2) Install LaserSell

LaserSell is distributed as a proprietary precompiled binary.

Run:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

Then verify:

```shellscript
lasersell --version
```

- [Windows Installation (WSL)](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/windows-installation)
- [Docker Installation](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/docker-installation)

## 3) Run the onboarding wizard (creates config + encrypted wallet)

Start LaserSell:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

If no config exists, the wizard runs automatically on first launch. You can run it any time with:

```shellscript
lasersell --setup
```

### What it creates

By default, the wizard creates:

- `~/.lasersell/config.yml`
- `~/.lasersell/wallet.keystore.json`

### Important: use a real interactive terminal

The wizard requires a real TTY. Don’t run the wizard through a non-interactive service/pipe.

### Recommended “fast path” answers

When prompted:

1. **Use recommended settings?** → **Yes**\
   (This applies defaults and skips extra questions.)
2. **RPC provider**

- **Helius (Recommended)** → enter your API key
- **Private Node** → enter your `https://...` RPC URL
- **Public Node** → works, but least reliable under load

3. **WebSocket provider**

- **Helius WebSocket** (requires Helius Dev plan)
- **Private WebSocket** → enter your `wss://...` URL
- **Public WebSocket** → slowest / least reliable for fast detection

4. **Wallet**

- Create a new wallet (you’ll be shown a seed phrase once) **or**
- Import an existing wallet (seed phrase / base58 secret key / Solana keypair JSON)

5. **Security / passphrase**\
   Set a strong passphrase. There is no “forgot password”. If you lose it, the keystore is not recoverable.

Full walkthrough of every prompt:

- **Initial Setup**

## 4) Start LaserSell and verify it’s “ready”

After the wizard completes, run:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

Sanity checks:

- No obvious RPC / WebSocket connection errors
- Your wallet pubkey matches what you intended
- You understand your default strategy (take profit / stop loss / deadline / slippage)

If you want to inspect/edit settings manually:

- **LaserSell UI**
- **Example Configuration**

## 5) Pair the Chrome Extension dashboard (optional, recommended)

The extension gives you a real-time telemetry dashboard in Chrome.

1. Install + pin it:

- **Chrome Extension Installation**

2. Pair it to your running LaserSell:

- In the LaserSell command line, run:

```shellscript
extension code
```

- Copy the 10-character pairing code
- Paste it into the extension popup → **Connect**
- Open the side panel dashboard

### If `extension code` doesn’t work

`extension code` requires telemetry to be enabled.

Your config should include:

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```

## 6) Run 24/7 on a VPS (optional)

If you want LaserSell running continuously, use `tmux`.

Quick path:

```shellscript
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tmux -y

tmux new -s lasersell
lasersell
```

Detach without stopping LaserSell:

- `Ctrl` + `b`, then `d`

Re-attach later:

```shellscript
tmux attach -t lasersell
```

Read this before doing 24/7:

- Running continuously consumes RPC credits and keeps the wallet unlocked in memory during the session.\
  See: **Running LaserSell 24/7 (with Tmux)**

## Security and risk (don’t skip)

- LaserSell is non-custodial, but you are responsible for your keys and the results of your trades.
- Treat the trading wallet as a hot wallet. Don’t keep your entire stack in it. Sweep profits regularly.

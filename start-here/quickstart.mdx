LaserSell runs on your machine and automatically executes sells when it detects new positions you buy. It is non-custodial: your keys stay on your machine.

If you are brand new, read [What Is LaserSell](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/what-is-lasersell) first.

## What you'll do

By the end of this page, you will have:

- LaserSell installed
- A config file and encrypted wallet keystore created by the onboarding wizard
- LaserSell running and connected to your RPC

## 0) Before you start

You need two things.

### 1) RPC endpoint and API key

- **RPC URL** — a private HTTPS endpoint from [Helius](https://helius.dev), [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com), or any other Solana RPC provider
- **LaserSell API key** — get one free at [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io)

### 2) Wallet plan

Treat LaserSell as a **hot wallet**. Only fund it with what you intend to actively trade.

## 1) Install LaserSell

LaserSell is distributed as a proprietary precompiled binary.

Run:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

Then verify:

```shellscript
lasersell --version
```

- [Linux Installation](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/linux-installation)
- [macOS Installation](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/mac-os-installation)
- [Windows Installation (WSL)](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/windows-installation)
- [Docker Installation](https://docs.lasersell.io/installation/docker-installation)

## 2) Run the onboarding wizard (creates config + encrypted wallet)

Start LaserSell:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

If no config exists, the wizard runs automatically on first launch. You can run it any time with:

```shellscript
lasersell --setup
```

### What it creates

By default, the wizard creates:

- `~/.lasersell/config.yml`
- `~/.lasersell/wallet.keystore.json`

### Important: use a real interactive terminal

The wizard requires a real TTY. Don't run the wizard through a non-interactive service/pipe.

### Recommended "fast path" answers

When prompted:

1. **Use recommended settings?** → **Yes**
   (This applies defaults and skips extra questions.)

2. **RPC URL** → enter your private `https://...` RPC URL
   (Leave empty for the public endpoint — not recommended for production.)

3. **LaserSell API key** → enter your API key from [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io)

4. **Wallet**
   - Create a new wallet (you'll be shown a seed phrase once) **or**
   - Import an existing wallet (seed phrase / base58 secret key / Solana keypair JSON)

5. **Security / passphrase**
   Set a strong passphrase. There is no "forgot password". If you lose it, the keystore is not recoverable.

- **Initial Setup**

## 3) Start LaserSell and verify it's "ready"

After the wizard completes, run:

```shellscript
lasersell
```

You can also do a quick health check first:

```shellscript
lasersell --smoke
```

This verifies RPC connectivity and the exit API, printing `SMOKE OK` on success.

Sanity checks:

- No obvious RPC connection errors
- Your wallet pubkey matches what you intended
- You understand your default strategy (take profit / stop loss / trailing stop / deadline / slippage)

If you want to inspect/edit settings manually:

- **LaserSell UI**
- **Example Configuration**

## Security and risk (don't skip)

- LaserSell is non-custodial, but you are responsible for your keys and the results of your trades.
- Treat the trading wallet as a hot wallet. Don't keep your entire stack in it. Sweep profits regularly.

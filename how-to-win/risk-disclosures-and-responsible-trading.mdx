## ⚠️ Critical Warning

**LaserSell is a high-frequency trading automation tool designed for experienced cryptocurrency users.** By using this software, you acknowledge that you are interacting with the Solana blockchain, a permissionless and highly volatile environment. You are solely responsible for the custody of your private keys and the financial outcomes of your trades.

## 1. Operational & Software Risks

LaserSell is engineered for speed, but it operates within a complex stack of dependencies.

- **Network Latency & RPC Failure:** LaserSell relies on third-party RPC providers (e.g., Helius) and the Solana network status. Network congestion or RPC downtime can result in failed sell orders, meaning you may be stuck in a position longer than intended.
- **Execution Slippage:** High-frequency trading often involves "slippage," where the execution price differs from the trigger price. While LaserSell includes a `slippage_pad_bps` setting to help mitigate this, extreme volatility can still result in unexpected fill prices.
- **"As Is" Software:** This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. While rigorous testing is performed, undetected bugs or compatibility issues with future Solana protocol updates could impact performance.

## 2. Market Risks

The specific niche LaserSell targets (new token deployments) is the riskiest sector of the cryptocurrency market.

- **Liquidity Risk:** New tokens often have shallow liquidity. It is possible to hold a token that becomes impossible to sell because the liquidity pool has been withdrawn ("rugged") or the bonding curve has stalled.
- **Total Loss:** In the memecoin market, it is common for asset values to drop to zero within minutes. **Never deploy capital you cannot afford to lose entirely.**
- **Scams & Exploits:** LaserSell’s detection filters verify the creator match, but it cannot predict if a developer will dump their own supply or if the token metadata contains malicious content.

## 3. Security & Wallet Custody

Your private keys are your identity and your bank vault. LaserSell creates a "hot wallet" environment on your machine.

- **Keystore Encryption:** LaserSell uses industry-standard **Argon2id** hashing and **XChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption to secure your keystore files. However, this security depends entirely on the strength of your chosen passphrase.
- **Local Security:** If your computer is compromised (malware, screen loggers), your encrypted keystore and passphrase can be stolen.
  - **Recommendation:** Run LaserSell on a dedicated, clean machine or a secure VPS.
  - **Recommendation:** Do not keep your life savings in the "hot wallet" used for trading. Regularly sweep profits to a hardware wallet (Cold Storage).

## 4. Responsible Configuration

Using the software responsibly means configuring "Safety Gates" that protect you from emotional decision-making.

- **Mandatory Stop Losses:** A responsible configuration _always_ includes a `stop_loss`. Relying on manual intervention is too slow for this ecosystem.
  - _Example:_ Set `stop_loss: "30%"` to automatically exit if a trade turns against you.
- **Timeout Safeguards:** Markets can stagnate. Use the `deadline_timeout` feature to enforce a "time limit" on exposure. If a trade hasn't worked out in 120 seconds, it is often safer to exit and preserve capital.
- **Start Small:** When first using LaserSell, configure your `target_profit` and `stop_loss` with minimal amounts. Verify that the tool executes trades as you expect before increasing your position sizes.

## 5. Regulatory Compliance

- **Jurisdiction:** You are responsible for ensuring your trading activities comply with the laws and regulations of your local jurisdiction.
- **Taxes:** High-frequency trading generates a large volume of taxable events. You are solely responsible for tracking and reporting your transaction history for tax purposes.

<Warning>
LaserSell is an automated trading tool for experienced cryptocurrency users. You are solely responsible for the custody of your private keys and the financial outcomes of your trades.
</Warning>

## Software and network risks

- **RPC / network failures**: LaserSell depends on third-party RPC providers and the Solana network. Congestion or downtime can delay or fail sell orders, leaving you in a position longer than intended.
- **Execution slippage**: The fill price may differ from the trigger price during high volatility. The `slippage_pad_bps` setting helps, but cannot eliminate slippage entirely.
- **No warranty**: This software is provided "as is." Bugs or future Solana protocol changes could affect performance.

## Market risks

New token markets are the highest-risk sector in crypto.

- **Liquidity risk**: Tokens can become unsellable if liquidity is withdrawn (rug pull) or the bonding curve stalls.
- **Total loss**: Memecoin values commonly drop to zero within minutes. Never deploy capital you cannot afford to lose.
- **Scams**: LaserSell cannot predict whether a developer will dump supply or whether token metadata is malicious.

## Wallet security

LaserSell creates a hot wallet on your machine, encrypted with Argon2id + XChaCha20-Poly1305.

- Encryption strength depends entirely on your passphrase.
- If your machine is compromised, your keystore and passphrase can be stolen.
- Run LaserSell on a dedicated, clean machine.
- Do not keep large balances in your trading wallet. Sweep profits to a hardware wallet regularly.

## Responsible configuration

- **Always set a stop loss.** Relying on manual intervention is too slow for this market.
- **Use a deadline timeout.** If a trade has not worked out in a set number of seconds, exiting preserves capital.
- **Start small.** Verify LaserSell executes as expected with minimal amounts before increasing position sizes.

## Regulatory compliance

- You are responsible for ensuring your trading activities comply with local laws and regulations.
- Automated trading generates a high volume of taxable events. You are responsible for tracking and reporting transactions.

*By running LaserSell, you affirm that you have read this disclosure and accept these risks.*

## The LaserSell Philosophy: High-Frequency Scalping

LaserSell is not designed for "diamond handing" or long-term holding. It is purpose-built for **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** and high-frequency memecoin deployments.

The most successful users of this tool generally treat it as a volume instrument. The goal is not to hit one 100x trade, but to secure small, consistent wins that stack up over time.

### The Speed Game

In the Solana ecosystem, liquidity moves in seconds.

- **Duration:** Ideally, you should hold a position for **no longer than 5 minutes**.
- **Volume:** Users utilizing the tool to its full potential often execute **50–100 trades per day** (approx. 1 trade every 5–10 minutes).
- **Consistency:** A strategy of quick entries and automated exits reduces exposure to the volatility that often wipes out long-term holders in the memecoin market.

## Configuring a "Safe Default" Strategy

If you are new to high-frequency trading or simply want a baseline to start testing, we recommend a defensive configuration. This setup prioritizes securing modest profits and cutting losses quickly to preserve capital for the next trade.

Based on the `strategy` block in your `config.yml`, here is a recommended setup:

```yaml
strategy:
  # Target Profit: 0.2 SOL
  # We use a fixed SOL amount here to ensure the profit justifies the fees.
  target_profit: 0.2

  # Stop Loss: 30%
  # We use a percentage here to adapt to different buy sizes.
  stop_loss: "30%"

  # Time-based Force Sell: 2 Minutes (120 seconds)
  # If the TP or SL hasn't been hit in 2 minutes, get out.
  sell_all_timeout_sec: 120
```

### Why this configuration?

1. **Reasonable Take Profit (0.2 SOL):** In volatile markets, price spikes are fleeting. Setting a modest target like 0.2 SOL increases the probability of your sell order filling.
   - _Note:_ Users often find that their **realized profit is higher** than the configured target. Because LaserSell triggers the moment the threshold is met, upward momentum during the microseconds of transaction processing can result in a better final fill price.
2. **30% Stop Loss:** This prevents a bad trade from draining your wallet. It allows for normal volatility while protecting you from a "rug pull" or total collapse.
3. **The 2-Minute Timeout:** In HFT, if a coin hasn't performed within 2 minutes, the momentum is likely dead. Capital is better used in a new trade than stuck in a stagnant one.

## Developing Your Edge

LaserSell provides the execution speed, but **you** provide the logic. To be profitable, you must treat trading like a business.

### 1. Data-Driven Decisions

Do not trade blindly. Use external tools to validate your assumptions before running the bot.

- **Dune Analytics:** Create or view dashboards to analyze successful wallets. Look for patterns in entry times, gas fees paid, and exit timings.
- **Backtesting:** Look at historical charts of successful token launches. How long did the initial pump last? Did it last 30 seconds or 10 minutes? Adjust your `sell_all_timeout_sec` accordingly.

### 2. Identify Trends

The "Meta" changes weekly.

- Are dog coins trending? AI coins? Political coins?
- Identify the trend early and configure LaserSell to act on opportunities within that specific niche.

### 3. Volume & Frequency

Remember the core math of HFT:

> _100 trades x 0.1 SOL profit = 10 SOL profit_

This is often safer and more reproducible than trying to find one trade worth 10 SOL. By keeping your `target_profit` reasonable and your trade frequency high, you smooth out the variance of the market.

The LaserSell Chrome Extension provides a real-time telemetry dashboard directly in your browser side panel. Follow the steps below to install and pair the extension with your terminal.

## 1. Install from Chrome Web Store

1. Navigate to the [LaserSell page on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lasersell/llablajedejfnhljgakfahpiibmbkpbl).
2. Click the **Add to Chrome** button on the top right.
3. In the confirmation dialog that appears, review the permissions and click **Add extension**.

## 2. Pin the Extension

For quick access to your dashboard and pairing controls, we recommend pinning the extension to your toolbar.

1. Click the **Extensions** icon (puzzle piece) in the top right of your Chrome toolbar.
2. Find **LaserSell** in the list.
3. Click the **Pin** icon next to it. The LaserSell logo should now be visible in your toolbar.

Once installed, you must pair the extension with your local LaserSell terminal to view data. The extension does not collect or store private keys; it simply visualizes data sent from your running application.

1. **Start LaserSell** on your machine.
2. Look for the **pairing code** displayed in your terminal's standard output.
3. Click the **LaserSell icon** in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
4. Enter the 10-character **Pairing Code** from your terminal into the input field.
5. Click **Connect**.

## 4. Access the Dashboard

After pairing successfully:

- Click the **Open Side Panel** button in the popup, or simply click the extension icon again.
- The Chrome Side Panel will open on the right side of your browser, displaying your **Balance**, **Net PnL**, and **Active Sessions**.

> **Note:** If you need to switch terminals or reset your connection, you can click **Disconnect** at the top of the Side Panel dashboard.

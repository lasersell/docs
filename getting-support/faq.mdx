### 1. "Is my wallet safe? Does LaserSell have access to my private keys?"

**Answer:** Yes, it is safe, and no, we do not have access. LaserSell is **non-custodial**.

- **Local Storage:** Your private keys are generated and stored **locally on your machine** in an encrypted Keystore file.
- **No Cloud Access:** Keys are never sent to our servers or any cloud storage.
- **Local Signing:** Transactions are signed locally on your device before being broadcast to the network.

### 2. "Can I just run this on my laptop, or do I really need a VPS?"

**Answer:** You _can_ run it on a laptop for testing, but we **strongly recommend** a Linux VPS for live trading to ensure 24/7 uptime and ultra-low latency.

- **Free Start:** Providers like Digital Ocean or Vultr often offer free credits, meaning you can essentially **run your VPS for free** for the first month or two while you learn.
- **Cost:** After the trial, it is very affordable, starting at around **\$6/month**.

### 3. "What coins can I trade? Can I trade USDC pairs or Raydium?"

**Answer:** Currently, LaserSell supports **SOL** pairs only ([Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), [Bags.fm](http://Bags.fm), and Meteora).

- **Not Supported Yet:** We do not currently support stablecoin pairs (USDC, USD1) or standard AMM structures like Raydium or [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), though these are planned for the future.

### 4. "I paid for the subscription. Does that include the RPC node?"

**Answer:** No. The LaserSell subscription covers the software license only. You must provide your own Private RPC endpoint.

- **Free Plans:** Most providers (like QuickNode or Helius) offer **Free Tiers** that are perfect for setting up and running test simulations before you pay.
- **Why Private?** Public nodes are too slow and rate-limited for high-frequency sniping.

Find quick answers to the most common questions about LaserSell, covering security, setup, and billing. If you cannot find what you are looking for here, please join our community support channels for direct assistance.

### 1. "Can I use my license on multiple wallets?"

**Answer:** No, your license is strictly bound to **one wallet address** at a time. However, you are not stuck forever.

- **Switching Wallets:** You can instantly update your bound wallet address at any time via the LaserSell Dashboard if you need to rotate to a fresh account.
- **License Rotation:** If your key is compromised, you can generate a new one immediately, which will revoke the old key.

### 2. "Is my wallet safe? Does LaserSell have access to my private keys?"

**Answer:** Yes, it is safe, and no, we do not have access. LaserSell is **non-custodial**.

- **Local Storage:** Your private keys are generated and stored **locally on your machine** in an encrypted Keystore file.
- **No Cloud Access:** Keys are never sent to our servers or any cloud storage.
- **Local Signing:** Transactions are signed locally on your device before being broadcast to the network.

### 3. "Can I just run this on my laptop, or do I really need a VPS?"

**Answer:** You _can_ run it on a laptop for testing, but we **strongly recommend** a Linux VPS for live trading to ensure 24/7 uptime and ultra-low latency.

- **Free Start:** Providers like Digital Ocean or Vultr often offer free credits, meaning you can essentially **run your VPS for free** for the first month or two while you learn.
- **Cost:** After the trial, it is very affordable, starting at around **\$6/month**.

### 4. "What coins can I trade? Can I trade USDC pairs or Raydium?"

**Answer:** Currently, LaserSell supports **SOL** pairs only ([Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), [Bags.fm](http://Bags.fm), and Meteora).

- **Not Supported Yet:** We do not currently support stablecoin pairs (USDC, USD1) or standard AMM structures like Raydium or [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), though these are planned for the future.

### 5. "I paid for the subscription. Does that include the RPC node?"

**Answer:** No. The LaserSell subscription covers the software license only. You must provide your own Private RPC endpoint.

- **Free Plans:** Most providers (like QuickNode or Helius) offer **Free Tiers** that are perfect for setting up and running test simulations before you pay.
- **Why Private?** Public nodes are too slow and rate-limited for high-frequency sniping.

## Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in any LaserSell product, please report it responsibly:

- **Email:** [security@lasersell.io](mailto:security@lasersell.io)
- **PGP:** We encourage encrypting your report with our [PGP key](https://www.lasersell.io/lasersell-pgp-key.asc). Full disclosure guidelines are at [www.lasersell.io/.well-known/security.txt](https://www.lasersell.io/.well-known/security.txt).

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Software bugs

For bugs in LaserSell or the LaserSell SDK, use one of these channels:

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - [lasersell/lasersell](https://github.com/lasersell/lasersell/issues) (Client)
  - [lasersell/lasersell-sdk](https://github.com/lasersell/lasersell-sdk/issues) (SDK)
- **Discord Ticket:** Open a support ticket in [discord.gg/lasersell](https://discord.gg/lasersell)

When reporting, include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, error messages, your OS/platform, and the version (`lasersell --version`).

### Resolution process

We aim to triage and fix confirmed bugs promptly.

- **Notification:** Once a fix is implemented, we will notify you so you can pull the latest update.
- **Updates:** Check the [LaserSell Announcements](https://t.me/lasersell) Telegram channel or the `#announcements` Discord channel to verify the fix is included in your build.

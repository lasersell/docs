A collection of key terms, acronyms, and concepts used throughout the LaserSell ecosystem and documentation.

## A

**Argon2id** A memory-hard password hashing algorithm used by LaserSell to derive your encryption key from your passphrase. It makes your wallet highly resistant to brute-force attacks.

## B

**Bonding Curve** A mathematical formula used by some decentralized exchanges and token launchpads to determine the price of a token based on its supply. LaserSell monitors these curves to detect new liquidity.

## C

**Cold Storage** Offline wallet storage (such as a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor) used for long-term holdings. It is recommended to sweep profits from your "Hot Wallet" to Cold Storage regularly.

**Confirmation Timeout** A setting (`confirm_timeout_sec`) that determines how long the bot waits for the network to confirm a transaction before retrying or cancelling.

## H

**Helius** A Solana-specific RPC provider recommended for use with LaserSell. It offers features like "Geyser" plugins and superior transaction propagation, making it ideal for sniping new launches.

**High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** A trading strategy characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and short holding periods. LaserSell is purpose-built for HFT, where users may execute 50–100 trades per day.

**Hot Wallet** Any wallet that is connected to the internet for active trading. LaserSell creates a local hot wallet on your machine to execute trades quickly.

## K

**Keystore** An encrypted file format used by LaserSell to store your private keys locally. It replaces insecure plaintext JSON files (like `id.json`) and requires a passphrase to decrypt.

## L

**Laserstream** A proprietary low-latency backend service provided by LaserSell for streaming market data, available when using a Helius Pro Plan.

**Liquidity Pool** A collection of funds locked in a smart contract that allows for the trading of a token pair. LaserSell detects when these pools are created to find new trading opportunities.

## M

**Memecoins** Cryptocurrencies often inspired by internet memes, characterized by high volatility and risk. This is the primary market niche LaserSell is designed to navigate.

## P

**Pairing Code** A 10-character code generated by the LaserSell terminal used to securely link the Chrome Extension dashboard to your running bot.

**Passphrase** The user-defined password required to unlock your encrypted Keystore. If this passphrase is lost, the wallet cannot be decrypted.

**Priority Fee** A standard Solana blockchain fee required to process high-priority computations on the network.

**Private Key** The alphanumeric string that grants control over the assets in a wallet. LaserSell encrypts this key locally and never transmits it to any server.

## R

**Rate Limits (RPS)** "Requests Per Second." The limit on how many times your bot can query the blockchain. Private RPC providers offer higher RPS limits to prevent your bot from being blocked during high-traffic moments.

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** A node that acts as a gateway to the Solana blockchain. LaserSell uses an RPC connection to read market data and broadcast transactions. A private RPC is required for effective sniping.

**Rug Pull** A malicious act where developers withdraw all liquidity from a pool or disable selling, causing the token's value to drop to zero. LaserSell's stop-loss features help mitigate this risk.

## S

**Safety Fee** A reduced fee of 0.7% applied to trades that are closed via a Stop Loss or Timeout (break-even or loss scenarios). This replaces the standard Success Fee.

**Seed Phrase** A 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrase used to generate or restore a wallet. LaserSell displays this only once during the initial wallet creation.

**Sell All Timeout** A "time limit" configuration (`sell_all_timeout_sec`) that forces the bot to exit a position if the target profit or stop loss hasn't been hit within a set duration (e.g., 120 seconds).

**Slippage** The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it effectively executes. High volatility can cause significant slippage.

**Sniping** The act of buying a new token launch in the very first block or milliseconds after it becomes tradable.

**Stop Loss** A risk management setting that automatically sells a position if the price drops by a specified percentage or amount, preventing further losses.

**Success Fee** A 5% fee charged by LaserSell only on the _profit_ generated from a winning trade. It is not charged on the principal investment.

## T

**Target Profit** A configuration setting that triggers an automatic sell order when a position's value increases by a specified amount (e.g., 0.2 SOL) or percentage.

**Telemetry** The system that pushes real-time statistics (PnL, logs) from your VPS to the cloud, allowing you to view them in the Chrome Extension.

## V

**Validator Acceleration Tip** A direct payment ("bribe") to network validators to prioritize your transaction above others in the same block, ensuring faster execution.

**VPS (Virtual Private Server)** A remote server hosted in a data center. Running LaserSell on a Linux VPS is recommended for 24/7 uptime, security, and ultra-low latency connections to the blockchain.

## W

**WebSockets (WSS)** A communication protocol that allows for real-time, two-way data streams. LaserSell uses WSS to listen for on-chain events (like new token launches) in milliseconds.

**XChaCha20-Poly1305** The high-performance authenticated encryption algorithm used by LaserSell to secure your private keys within the Keystore file.

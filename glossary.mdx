## A

**AMM (Automated Market Maker)**
A decentralized exchange protocol that uses mathematical formulas to determine token prices based on pool reserves, enabling token swaps without order books. PumpSwap, Meteora DAMM V2, and Raydium CPMM are examples of AMMs supported by LaserSell.

**Argon2id**
A memory-hard password hashing algorithm used by LaserSell to derive encryption keys from your passphrase. Makes brute-force attacks against your keystore computationally expensive.

**Associated Token Account (ATA)**
A derived on-chain account that holds a specific SPL token for a given wallet address. Created automatically when a wallet first receives a token.

**Astralane Iris**
A transaction submission gateway that supports regional endpoints for latency optimization. One of the available [send targets](/api/transactions/send-targets) in the LaserSell SDKs. Requires an Astralane API key.

**Atomic Units**
The smallest indivisible unit of a token. For SOL, the atomic unit is a lamport (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports). Other tokens define their own decimal precision.

## B

**Balance Update**
A server event (`balance_update`) sent by the Exit Intelligence Stream when your wallet's SOL or token balance changes. See [Server Events](/api/stream/server-events).

**Basis Points (BPS)**
A unit equal to 1/100th of a percent. 100 bps = 1%. Used throughout the LaserSell API for slippage tolerance and partner fee configuration.

**Bonding Curve**
A mathematical formula used by launchpads like Pump.fun to determine a token's price based on its circulating supply. Tokens on a bonding curve have not yet migrated to an AMM pool.

## C

**Cold Storage**
Offline wallet storage (such as a hardware wallet) used for long-term holdings. Sweep profits from your hot wallet to cold storage regularly.

**Configure Message**
The first client message sent after connecting to the Exit Intelligence Stream. Specifies your wallet addresses and strategy parameters. The server responds with a `configured` event. See [Client Messages](/api/stream/client-messages).

## D

**Deadline Timeout**
A time limit (in seconds) that forces an automatic exit if no other strategy condition (target profit, stop loss, trailing stop) fires within the configured duration. Prevents capital from being locked in stagnant positions.

## E

**Exit Intelligence**
LaserSell's core technology. A real-time system that monitors wallet positions, evaluates strategy conditions on every price update, and delivers pre-built unsigned exit transactions when thresholds are met.

**Exit Intelligence Stream**
A persistent WebSocket connection to `wss://stream.lasersell.io/v1/ws` that provides real-time position tracking, PnL updates, and automated exit signals. See [Stream Overview](/api/stream/overview).

**Exit Signal**
A server event (`exit_signal_with_tx`) containing a pre-built unsigned sell transaction, fired when a strategy condition is met. The most important event in the Exit Intelligence Stream. See [Server Events](/api/stream/server-events).

**ExitApiClient**
The SDK client for making REST API calls to build buy and sell transactions on demand via `/v1/buy` and `/v1/sell`.

## G

**Graduation**
The moment when a token migrates from a bonding curve (e.g. Pump.fun) to an AMM pool (e.g. PumpSwap). Price dynamics often shift significantly at graduation.

## H

**`hello_ok`**
The first server message received after connecting to the Exit Intelligence Stream. Contains your session ID and tier rate limits. See [Connection Lifecycle](/api/stream/connection-lifecycle).

**Helius Sender**
A transaction submission service that routes through the Helius `/fast` endpoint for optimized transaction landing on Solana. No API key required. The default [send target](/api/transactions/send-targets) for LaserSell.

**Hot Wallet**
Any wallet connected to the internet for active trading. LaserSell creates a local hot wallet on your machine for fast trade execution.

## J

**Jito Tip**
A direct payment to Solana validators to prioritize your transaction above others in the same block. This is a network cost, not a LaserSell fee.

## K

**Keystore**
An encrypted file format used by the LaserSell client to store your private keys locally. Uses XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption with an Argon2id-derived key. See [Wallet Encryption](/security/wallet-encryption).

## L

**Lamport**
The smallest unit of SOL. 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports. API fields like `amount_quote_units`, `tip_lamports`, and `partner_fee_lamports` are denominated in lamports.

**Lane Splitting**
A feature (TypeScript SDK only) that separates the Exit Intelligence Stream into two receivers: a high-priority lane for exit signals and position events, and a low-priority lane for PnL updates. Prevents frequent PnL updates from blocking time-sensitive exit signals.

## M

**Market Context**
Metadata describing the DEX pool and protocol used for a token's market, including pool addresses and configuration. Returned in stream events and optionally passed to build requests to skip server-side resolution. See [Market Context](/api/reference/market-context).

**Memecoin**
A cryptocurrency often inspired by internet culture, characterized by high volatility and speculative trading. The primary market segment LaserSell is designed for.

**Meteora DBC (Dynamic Bonding Curve)**
Meteora's bonding curve protocol for tokens in their initial launch phase. Supported by LaserSell.

**Meteora DAMM V2 (Dynamic AMM V2)**
Meteora's dynamic automated market maker for tokens that have migrated from their bonding curve. Supported by LaserSell.

**Mode (Routing)**
A field on `/v1/buy` and `/v1/sell` requests with values `"fast"` or `"secure"`. Fast mode optimizes for speed; secure mode adds additional confirmation checks. Not to be confused with Send Mode.

## N

**Non-Custodial**
An architecture where users retain full control of their private keys and funds. LaserSell never stores keys on its servers. All transactions are returned unsigned and signed locally by the user or their application.

## P

**Partner Fee**
An optional fee that integrators can add to any buy or sell transaction, routed atomically to a specified wallet as part of the on-chain swap. Configurable in basis points or flat lamports per request. Available on Advanced and Enterprise tiers. See [Partner Fees](/api/reference/partner-fees).

**Passphrase**
The user-defined password required to unlock an encrypted keystore. If this passphrase is lost, the wallet cannot be decrypted.

**PnL (Profit and Loss)**
The current estimated profit or loss on a position. The Exit Intelligence Stream delivers `pnl_update` events at regular intervals with updated values.

**`pnl_update`**
A server event containing the latest PnL calculation for a tracked position. Delivered at regular intervals. High-frequency delivery is the reason lane splitting exists. See [Server Events](/api/stream/server-events).

**Position Handle**
A reference object returned by `StreamSession` events that identifies a tracked position by its ID, token account, mint, and wallet. Used for closing positions and requesting exit signals.

**`position_opened`**
A server event fired when the Exit Intelligence Stream detects a new token purchase in a tracked wallet. Contains the position ID, mint, cost basis, and market context. See [Server Events](/api/stream/server-events).

**`position_closed`**
A server event fired when a tracked position is fully exited or removed. See [Server Events](/api/stream/server-events).

**Priority Fee**
A standard Solana blockchain fee paid to validators for computational priority. Separate from Jito tips.

**Private Key**
The cryptographic key that grants control over a wallet's assets. The LaserSell client encrypts this locally and never transmits it. The API and SDKs never require a private key; all transactions are returned unsigned.

**Pump.fun**
A Solana token launchpad where tokens begin trading on a bonding curve before graduating to an AMM.

**PumpSwap**
The AMM that Pump.fun tokens migrate to after graduating from the bonding curve. Supported by LaserSell.

## R

**Rate Limits**
Caps on how many requests or resources you can use, determined by your pricing tier. Applies to both the REST API (requests per minute) and the Exit Intelligence Stream (wallets, positions, sessions). See [Rate Limits and Tiers](/api/reference/rate-limits).

**Raydium CPMM (Constant Product Market Maker)**
Raydium's standard AMM pools. Supported by LaserSell.

**Raydium Launchpad**
Raydium's token launch platform. Supported by LaserSell.

**Routing Fee**
LaserSell's flat 1% fee on the total transaction value of every sell order executed through the LaserSell Router. Enforced atomically on-chain. See [Fee Structure](/pricing/fee-structure).

**RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
A node that serves as a gateway to the Solana blockchain. LaserSell uses an RPC connection to read chain data and broadcast transactions. A private RPC endpoint is recommended for production use.

**Rug Pull**
A scenario where a token's liquidity is withdrawn or selling is disabled, causing the price to collapse. LaserSell's stop loss, trailing stop, and sell on graduation features help limit exposure.

## S

**Seed Phrase**
A 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrase used to generate or restore a wallet. Displayed only once during initial wallet creation.

**Sell on Graduation**
A strategy condition that automatically exits a position the moment its token migrates from a bonding curve to an AMM pool. Protects against post-graduation dumps.

**Send Mode**
A field on build requests (`"rpc"`, `"helius_sender"`, or `"astralane"`) that tells the server which submission context to optimize the transaction for. Should match your chosen send target.

**Send Target**
A configuration that tells the SDK where to submit a signed transaction. Options: Default RPC, Custom RPC, Helius Sender, Astralane Iris. See [Send Targets](/api/transactions/send-targets).

**Slippage**
The difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual execution price. High volatility and low liquidity increase slippage.

**Stop Loss**
A strategy condition that automatically sells a position when the price drops by a configured percentage from the entry price. Limits downside on any single trade.

**StreamClient**
The low-level SDK client for the Exit Intelligence Stream. Manages the WebSocket connection, reconnection, and message framing. Returns raw server messages. See [Connection Lifecycle](/api/stream/connection-lifecycle).

**StreamSession**
The high-level SDK wrapper around `StreamClient`. Provides automatic position tracking, deadline timers, typed events with position handles, and strategy update methods. Recommended for most integrations.

## T

**Target Profit**
A strategy condition that triggers an automatic sell when a position's PnL reaches a configured profit percentage.

**Trailing Stop**
A dynamic stop loss that tracks the highest profit observed since a position opened. If the profit drops from that peak by a configured percentage, an exit signal fires. Locks in gains on positions that pump before reversing.

## U

**USD1**
A stablecoin supported as an alternative output asset for sell transactions (instead of SOL).

**Unsigned Transaction**
A base64-encoded Solana `VersionedTransaction` returned by the LaserSell API. Must be signed locally with your private key before submission. LaserSell never handles signing.

## V

**VersionedTransaction**
A Solana transaction format that supports versioned instruction layouts and address lookup tables. All transactions returned by the LaserSell API use this format.

## W

**WebSocket (WSS)**
A communication protocol enabling real-time, bidirectional data streams. The Exit Intelligence Stream uses WSS to deliver position events and exit signals with minimal latency.

## X

**XChaCha20-Poly1305**
The authenticated encryption algorithm used by the LaserSell client to secure private keys within the keystore file. Provides both confidentiality and integrity verification.

Key safety is the absolute foundation of the LaserSell architecture. We understand that in the high-stakes environment of cryptocurrency trading, the security of your private keys is paramount.

This page details the specific measures LaserSell takes to isolate your credentials, encrypt your data, and protect your funds from unauthorized access.

## The Non-Custodial Guarantee

**"Your Keys, Your Machine."**

LaserSell is a strictly **Non-Custodial** trading tool. Unlike cloud-based trading bots or web interfaces where you surrender custody of your funds to a third party, LaserSell runs entirely on your local hardware (your personal computer or your private VPS).

- **No Cloud Storage:** Your private keys are generated and stored locally. They are never sent to our servers or any external logging service.
- **Local Signing:** All transactions are signed locally on your device before being broadcast to the Solana network.
- **Total Control:** Because the software does not transmit your keys, we cannot freeze your funds, initiate withdrawals, or execute trades without your command.

## Industry-Leading Encryption

Many trading scripts and lower-tier bots store your wallet as a plaintext `wallet.json` file. This is a massive security risk; if a hacker gains access to your file system, they can simply open that file and steal your funds.

LaserSell replaces this outdated method with a robust **Encrypted Keystore** system.

### How It Protects You

1. **Authenticated Encryption:** When you initialize LaserSell, your private key is encrypted using industry-standard authenticated encryption algorithms. This wraps your key in a mathematical "vault" that can only be opened with your unique passphrase.
2. **Brute-Force Resistance:** The keystore utilizes memory-hard key derivation functions. Even if a bad actor steals your keystore file, the computational cost to guess your passphrase via brute-force attacks is prohibitively high.
3. **Automatic Migration:** If you currently use a legacy plaintext `wallet.json` from another tool, LaserSell detects this and offers to automatically migrate it to our secure Keystore format, ensuring you don't leave vulnerable files on your disk.

> **Important:** Because your security depends entirely on your passphrase, **there is no "Forgot Password" feature.** If you lose your passphrase, the keystore file is mathematically impossible to decrypt.

## **Memory Hygiene (Secure Unlocking)**

Security isn’t just about files on a disk; it is also about how credentials are handled in memory. LaserSell utilizes advanced **Memory Wiping** techniques during the unlocking process. When you start a session:

- Your **passphrase and decryption intermediates** are held in Random Access Memory (RAM) only for the split second they are needed.
- Immediately after your wallet is unlocked, these sensitive secrets are explicitly “zeroized” (scrubbed).
- This ensures your master password never lingers in memory, protecting you against malware that attempts to scrape credentials from running applications.

## Best Practices for Wallet Management

While LaserSell is hardened against attacks, you should always practice good Operational Security (OpSec).

### 1. Treat LaserSell as a "Hot Wallet"

A "Hot Wallet" is any wallet connected to the internet for active trading.

- **Do not** keep your entire net worth in your trading wallet.
- **Do not** use your main HODL wallet or hardware wallet seed phrase for high-frequency trading.

### 2. Regular Fund Rotation

We strongly recommend separating your long-term holdings from your active trading funds:

- **Cold Storage:** Use a hardware wallet (like  Trezor) to store your main portfolio and accumulated profits.
- **Trading Wallet:** Only transfer the specific amount of SOL/USDC you intend to trade with for the current session or day into your LaserSell wallet.
- **Routine:** Establish a habit of regularly "sweeping" profits from your LaserSell wallet back to your Cold Storage or exchange account.

## Chrome Extension Safety

The LaserSell Chrome Extension is designed as a passive **Telemetry Viewer**.

- It connects to the LaserSell cloud API strictly to visualize performance data (graphs, logs, and PnL).
- It **does not** communicate directly with the trading engine or the keystore on your computer.
- It **cannot** sign transactions, withdraw funds, or access your private key.

## Anti-Phishing & Support Policy

Social engineering is the most common way traders lose funds. Please remember our strict policy:

- **We will NEVER ask for your Private Key or Seed Phrase.**
- **We will NEVER ask for your Keystore Passphrase.**
- **We will NEVER ask you to "validate" or "synchronize" your wallet on a website.**

If anyone claiming to be "LaserSell Support" asks for these things, they are a scammer. Block and report them immediately.

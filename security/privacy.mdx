LaserSell is designed to operate with a "Least Privilege" network philosophy. We only transmit the data strictly necessary to verify your license and power your dashboard. **Crucially, all trade construction and signing happen locally on your machine.**

This page details exactly what data leaves your machine, where it goes, and who has access to it.

#### The Data We See (And Don't See)

We believe transparency is the best defense against distrust. Here is a complete breakdown of our data visibility:

| Data Type            | Visibility         | Where it lives                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private Keys & Seeds | **ZERO ACCESS**    | **Strictly Local.** Encrypted on your disk. Your keys never leave your machine.                                                                                                   |
| Strategy Logic       | **ZERO ACCESS**    | **Strictly Local.** Your buying/selling logic, stop losses, and profit targets run entirely on your machine.                                                                      |
| Trade Construction   | **ZERO ACCESS**    | **Strictly Local.** Unlike other bots, we do **not** require you to send trade requests to our API. Your bot builds and signs transactions locally using your own RPC connection. |
| Wallet Public Key    | Visible            | Sent to our API for license validation and to the Telemetry Cloud to identify your session.                                                                                       |
| PnL & Performance    | Visible (Optional) | Sent to our Telemetry Cloud to power your Chrome Extension dashboard. This includes profit, loss, and trade signatures _after_ execution.                                         |
| IP Address           | Visible            | Visible to our APIs (License/Telemetry) and your RPC Provider.                                                                                                                    |

## Network Connections

When LaserSell is running, it establishes outbound connections to four distinct destinations:

**1. The Solana Network (RPC)**

- **Destination:** Your configured RPC provider (e.g., Helius, QuickNode).
- **Purpose:** Reading market data (prices, bonding curves) and simulating transactions.
- **Privacy Implication:** Your RPC provider can see your IP address and the read requests you make.

**2. Helius High-Speed Sender**

- **Destination:** `https://sender.helius-rpc.com/fast`
- **Purpose:** **Broadcasting Transactions.** Once your bot locally signs a trade, it sends the signed transaction directly to this high-speed endpoint to ensure the fastest possible landing on-chain.
- **Privacy Implication:** Helius sees the signed transaction payload immediately before it hits the chain.

**3. LaserSell API Server**

- **Destination:** `api.lasersell.app`
- **Purpose:** **License Check Only.** On startup and periodically, the bot verifies your license key and wallet ownership.

**4. Telemetry & Dashboard**

- **Destination:** `telemetry.lasersell.app`
- **Purpose:** Pushes real-time stats (Profit/Loss, active positions, balance) to the cloud so you can view them in the LaserSell Chrome Extension.
- **Privacy Implication:** This data allows you to monitor your bot remotely. It does not allow remote control. The connection is one-way (upload only).

## Chrome Extension Privacy

The LaserSell Chrome Extension is a **Passive Viewer**.

- It does **not** connect to your VPS directly (no open ports required).
- It does **not** have access to your VPS file system or keystores.
- It simply authenticates with our Telemetry Cloud to display the data your bot has pushed there.
- If you uninstall the extension or close the browser, your bot continues running on your VPS unaffected.

## Opting Out (Going "Dark")

For users who demand maximum privacy, LaserSell offers total control over telemetry.

### Disabling Telemetry

You can disable the connection to `telemetry.lasersell.app` by editing your `config.yml` on your VPS.

1. SSH into your VPS.
2. Open your config file (e.g., `nano config.yml`).
3. Scroll to the `telemetry` section at the bottom.
4. Set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml
# config.yml

telemetry:
  # Set this to false to stop sending PnL/stats to the cloud
  enabled: false 
```

- **Result:** Your bot will stop sending PnL updates to the cloud.
- **Trade-off:** The Chrome Extension will no longer update. You will need to monitor your bot strictly via the terminal (SSH session).

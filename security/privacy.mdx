LaserSell is designed to operate with a "Least Privilege" network philosophy. We only transmit the data strictly necessary to execute your trades and verify your license.

This page details exactly what data leaves your machine, where it goes, and who has access to it.

## The Data We See (And Don't See)

We believe transparency is the best defense against distrust. Here is a complete breakdown of our data visibility:

| Data Type            | Visibility         | Where it lives                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private Keys & Seeds | ZERO ACCESS        | **Strictly Local.** Encrypted on your disk and in your RAM.            |
| Strategy Logic       | ZERO ACCESS        | **Strictly Local.** Your buying/selling logic runs on your machine.    |
| Wallet Public Key    | Visible            | Sent to our API for license validation and trade routing.              |
| Trade Requests       | Visible            | Sent to our API to construct optimized swap transactions.              |
| PnL & Performance    | Visible (Optional) | Sent to our Telemetry Cloud to power your Chrome Extension dashboard.  |
| IP Address           | Visible            | Visible to us (API) and your RPC Provider. (This will be your VPS IP). |

## Network Connections

When LaserSell is running, it establishes outbound connections to three distinct destinations.

### 1. The Solana Network (RPC)

- **Destination:** Your configured RPC provider (e.g., Helius, QuickNode, or a private validator).
- **Purpose:** Reading market data (prices, bonding curves) and broadcasting signed transactions.
- **Privacy Implication:** Your RPC provider can see your VPS IP address and the transactions you submit.

### 2. LaserSell Optimization Cloud

- **Destination:** `api.lasersell.app`
- **Purpose:**
  - **License Check:** Verifies your access rights on startup.
  - **Transaction Routing:** When you trigger a sell, your bot sends a "Quote Request" (e.g., "Sell 100% of Token X"). Our server calculates the optimal route, fees, and slippage protection, then returns an **unsigned** transaction payload.
- **Security Note:** This connection is purely for _construction_. The signing happens locally on your VPS after the payload is received.

### 3. Telemetry & Dashboard

- **Destination:** `telemetry.lasersell.app`
- **Purpose:** Pushes real-time stats (Profit/Loss, active positions, logs) to the cloud so you can view them in the LaserSell Chrome Extension without needing to SSH into your server constantly.
- **Privacy Implication:** This data allows you to monitor your bot remotely. It does **not** allow remote control. The connection is one-way (upload only).

## Chrome Extension Privacy

The LaserSell Chrome Extension is a **Passive Viewer**.

- It does **not** connect to your VPS directly (no open ports required).
- It does **not** have access to your VPS file system or keystores.
- It simply authenticates with our Telemetry Cloud to display the data your bot has pushed there.
- If you uninstall the extension or close the browser, your bot continues running on your VPS unaffected.

## Opting Out (Going "Dark")

For users who demand maximum privacy, LaserSell offers total control over telemetry.

### Disabling Telemetry

You can disable the connection to `telemetry.lasersell.app` by editing your `config.yml` on your VPS.

1. SSH into your VPS.
2. Open your config file (e.g., `nano config.yml`).
3. Scroll to the `telemetry` section at the bottom.
4. Set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml
# config.yml

telemetry:
  # Set this to false to stop sending PnL/stats to the cloud
  enabled: false 
```

- **Result:** Your bot will stop sending PnL updates to the cloud.
- **Trade-off:** The Chrome Extension will no longer update. You will need to monitor your bot strictly via the terminal (SSH session).
- **Note:** License checks and Transaction Routing (API connections) are mandatory for the bot to function and cannot be disabled.

### Local Logs

LaserSell writes detailed logs to your VPS disk (`logs/` directory relative to the binary). These logs may contain transaction signatures and public keys, but **never** private keys. We do not automatically upload these logs. They are yours to keep or delete.

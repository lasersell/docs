description: "What data LaserSell collects, where it goes, and your controls over it."
---

LaserSell is built on a "least privilege" network philosophy. All trade construction and signing happen locally on your machine. We only transmit data strictly necessary to authenticate your account, provide API services, and power the platform.

This page summarizes what data leaves your machine and where it goes. The full legal privacy policy is at [lasersell.io/privacy](https://www.lasersell.io/privacy).

## What stays local (zero access)

These never leave your machine:

| Data | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Private keys & seed phrases** | Encrypted on your disk in the keystore. Never transmitted. |
| **Strategy configuration** | Your TP, SL, trailing stop, deadline, and other settings run entirely locally. |
| **Trade construction & signing** | Transactions are built and signed on your machine, then sent directly to the Solana network via your RPC. |

## What we collect

### Authentication & accounts

- **Email and credentials**:stored in Supabase for account authentication on [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io).
- **OAuth profile data**:if you sign in via GitHub, X/Twitter, or Google, we receive limited profile info (no passwords).
- **MFA**:TOTP-based. We do not collect phone numbers.

### API & trading activity

- **Wallet public keys**:sent to the LaserSell API for authentication and session identification.
- **API keys**:stored encrypted for endpoint authentication.
- **Trading activity**:as the platform evolves, we plan to log activity tied to your API keys (PnL, configuration, trading frequency, wallet addresses) to improve the product and provide analytics.

### Payments

- **Stripe** handles all payment processing. We do not store raw credit card numbers on our servers.

### Technical data

- **IP addresses, user-agents, timestamps, and error traces**:collected in server logs for infrastructure monitoring and abuse prevention.
- **Google Analytics**:used on marketing and documentation sites only, not on the authenticated dashboard.
- **Essential cookies and local storage**:used on app.lasersell.io for session management.

## Network connections

When the LaserSell client is running, it establishes outbound connections to:

### 1. Solana network (your RPC)

- **Destination:** Your configured RPC provider (e.g., Helius, Chainstack).
- **Purpose:** Reading on-chain data (prices, bonding curves) and broadcasting signed transactions.
- **Note:** Your RPC provider can see your IP address and the requests you make.

### 2. Transaction sender (if applicable)

- **Destination:** Depends on your `send_target` setting:Helius sender, Astralane, or direct RPC.
- **Purpose:** Broadcasting your locally-signed transactions for fast on-chain landing.
- **Note:** The sender sees the signed transaction payload.

### 3. LaserSell API

- **Destination:** `api.lasersell.app`
- **Purpose:** Authentication, license verification, and the Exit Intelligence Stream (WebSocket).

## Third-party services

We share data with these providers to operate the platform:

| Provider | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Stripe** | Payment processing |
| **Supabase** | Database and authentication |
| **Better Stack** | Log management (U.S.) |
| **Typeform** | Enterprise intake applications |
| **Solana RPC nodes** | On-chain data resolution |

We do **not** sell your personal information or API usage data to data brokers or for targeted advertising.

## Data retention

- **Account and billing data** is retained while your account is active.
- **Server logs** are routinely cycled or anonymized per operational security practices.

## Your rights

- Update your authentication methods and API keys via the [dashboard](https://app.lasersell.io).
- Request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by emailing [support@lasersell.io](mailto:support@lasersell.io).

## Security

We use encryption for API keys and session management, along with administrative and technical safeguards. If you discover a security vulnerability, report it to [security@lasersell.io](mailto:security@lasersell.io). We encourage use of our [PGP key](https://www.lasersell.io/lasersell-pgp-key.asc). See our [security.txt](https://www.lasersell.io/.well-known/security.txt) for full disclosure guidelines.

## Jurisdiction

Information may be transferred to the U.S. or other jurisdictions where our service providers operate. Our services are intended for users 18 and older.

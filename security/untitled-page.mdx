title: "Threat Model"

This document outlines the security architecture of LaserSell. It defines the trust boundaries between your local machine, our infrastructure, and the Solana network.

We believe in **Transparency through Architecture**: we describe _what_ our security guarantees are, so you can trust the software without needing to trust our servers blindly.

## Trust Boundaries

To understand your security, you must understand where your sensitive data lives.

| Component        | Location         | Access Level                                               | Security Status                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| LaserSell Client | Your Device      | **Full Access.** Holds private keys, signs transactions.   | Trusted (User Controlled)       |
| LaserSell Cloud  | Our Servers      | **No Key Access.** optimizing routes, validating licenses. | Zero-Trust (Verified by Client) |
| Chrome Extension | Your Browser     | **Read-Only.** Views PnL and logs.                         | Passive Viewer                  |
| RPC Provider     | Helius / Private | **Network Access.** Broadcasts signed transactions.        | Untrusted Transport             |

## 1. The "Malicious Server" Scenario

**The Concern:** "What if LaserSell's servers are hacked? Can the attacker drain my wallet?"

**The Guarantee:** **No.** Your funds are mathematically protected by Client-Side Validation.

LaserSell uses a unique **Double-Verification Protocol**:

1. **Server-Side:** Our Routing Engine constructs an optimized transaction (handling slippage, fees, and routing) and cryptographically signs it using our server's key.
2. **Client-Side:** Your local bot receives this payload and performs a rigorous inspection **before** your private key is ever touched:
   - **Signature Check:** Verifies the transaction truly came from LaserSell.
   - **Intent Check:** Verifies the transaction is _exactly_ what you requested (e.g., "Sell 100 tokens of Mint X").
   - **Destination Check:** Verifies funds are returning to _your_ wallet, not a third-party address.

**Result:** If a hacker compromised our server and tried to send a "Drain Wallet" transaction to your bot, your local client would detect the mismatch (e.g., "Recipient is not me") and strictly refuse to sign it.

## 2. The "Compromised Browser" Scenario

**The Concern:** "If I install a malicious Chrome extension or click a bad link, is my bot safe?"

**The Guarantee:** **Yes.** The LaserSell Chrome Extension is Air-Gapped from your Private Keys.

The LaserSell Chrome Extension is built as a **Passive Telemetry Viewer**.

- **No Signing Capability:** The extension creates a secure, read-only connection to our telemetry cloud. It technically _cannot_ sign transactions or execute trades.
- **One-Way Data Flow:** Your bot pushes status updates up to the cloud. The cloud pushes updates down to the browser. There is no direct "Command and Control" channel from the browser to the bot's core wallet kernel.

**Result:** Even if your browser is totally compromised, the attacker can only _see_ your PnL. They cannot execute trades or withdraw funds.

## 3. The "Man-in-the-Middle" Scenario

**The Concern:** "Can someone intercept my traffic and modify my trades?"

**The Guarantee:** **No.** All traffic is encrypted and authenticated.

- **Transport Layer:** All communication between your client and our API uses TLS (HTTPS) encryption.
- **Application Layer:** Critical payloads are signed. Even if an attacker stripped the TLS encryption, they could not modify the transaction instructions without invalidating the cryptographic signatures enforced by your local client.

## 4. Supply Chain & Updates

**The Concern:** "What if a hacker pushes a malicious update?"

**The Guarantee:** **Signed Binaries.** All LaserSell binaries are cryptographically signed. Your operating system (Windows/macOS/Linux) verifies these signatures before execution. We employ strict dependency pinning to prevent upstream attacks from sneaking into our build process.

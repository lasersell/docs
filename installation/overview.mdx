---

LaserSell is distributed as a **proprietary, precompiled binary**. The official install entrypoint for all platforms is:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

This install script is the **recommended** method and is used for Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL).

### Supported Platforms

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)** via `install.sh` or manual APT setup
- **macOS** via `install.sh` or Homebrew (or tarball mode)
- **Windows** is supported **via WSL** (not a native `.exe` install)
- **Docker** (optional / advanced) using the official `lasersell/lasersell` image

### Migrating from the old repo

If you previously used the old `lasersell.github.io/apt` repo, run:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/migrate.sh | bash
```

### Upgrading

- APT: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install lasersell`
- Homebrew: `brew upgrade lasersell`
- Tarball install: rerun `install.sh` (overwrites the binary)

- `x86_64`

### Recommended Method: Install Script

The official install script:

- Detects architecture automatically
- Installs the correct binary
- Places `lasersell` on your `PATH`
- Handles updates cleanly

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, restart your shell or reload your profile.

### Verify Installation

```shellscript
lasersell --version
```

You should see the current LaserSell version printed.

### Permissions & PATH Notes

If `lasersell` is not found:

```shellscript
which lasersell
```

Ensure the install directory is included in your `PATH`.

### Docker setup (official)

This is the official Docker path and is designed to store LaserSell config files in a local folder you create (mounted into the container).

#### 1) Preparation

- Install Docker Desktop
- Create a new empty folder named `lasersell` (example: on your Desktop)

#### 2) Run & Setup

Open a terminal, `cd` into that folder, then run:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```shellscript
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app/.lasersell lasersell/lasersell
```

**Mac (Terminal):**

```shellscript
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/app/.lasersell" lasersell/lasersell
```

#### 3) What happens next

- On first run, the **LaserSell Setup Wizard** launches in the container.
- When finished, it writes `config.yml` and `config.keystore.json` into your `lasersell` folder (via the mounted volume).
- On next run, it detects those files and starts normally.

### Windows is supported via WSL

1. Install WSL (Windows Terminal or PowerShell as Administrator):

```shellscript
wsl --install
```

2. Restart your computer, then open your WSL Linux distro (e.g., Ubuntu), then run:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL https://dl.lasersell.io/install.sh | bash
```

### Verify (inside WSL)

```shellscript
lasersell --version
```

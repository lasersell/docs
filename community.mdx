We have established a dedicated Discord server as the central hub for our ecosystem. This is the best place to connect with the team and other users.

**Join here:** [**discord.gg/lasersell**](https://discord.gg/lasersell)

Inside the Discord, you can:

- **Discuss Strategy:** Talk with other traders about what settings are working in the current market conditions.
- **Talk Crypto:** Discuss broader market trends, new meta narratives, and token launches.
- **Get Help:** Troubleshoot configuration issues or ask questions about the software.

Whether you have a feature request, a bug report, or just want to discuss the roadmap, this is the best place to have that conversation in real-time.

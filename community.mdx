Trading can be a solitary activity, but you don't have to navigate the Solana ecosystem alone. LaserSell is built by traders, for traders, and we believe that sharing knowledge (and alpha) is the key to longevity in this market.

### **Join the Official Discord**

We have established a dedicated Discord server as the central hub for our ecosystem. This is the best place to connect with the team and other users.

**Join here:** [**https://discord.lasersell.io**](https://discord.lasersell.io)

Inside the Discord, you can:

- **Discuss Strategy:** Talk with other high-frequency traders about what settings are working in the current market conditions.
- **Talk Crypto:** Discuss broader market trends, new meta narratives, and token launches.
- **Get Help:** Troubleshoot configuration issues or ask questions about the software.

Whether you have a feature request, a bug report, or just want to discuss the roadmap, this is the best place to have that conversation in real-time.

### Direct Support & Contact

If you have a sensitive issue regarding your license, billing, or a private matter that you prefer not to discuss in the public chat, you can reach out directly to the founder.

- **Email:** `support@xen.world`
- **Instagram:** You can reach out via Direct Message (DM) on Instagram ([@xen](https://instagram.com/xen)).

We aim to respond to all support inquiries as quickly as possible.

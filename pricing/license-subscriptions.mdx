### Where to Purchase

You can purchase a license instantly through our official channels:

- **Whop Store:** [Insert Whop Link Here]
- **Official Dashboard:** [app.lasersell.io](http://app.lasersell.io)

> **Note:** The **LaserSell Chrome Extension** is completely **free** to use and does not require a paid subscription. The paid license applies specifically to the LaserSell terminal and advanced automation tools.

## How Licensing Works

To ensure the security and integrity of our network, LaserSell utilizes a **Wallet-Bound Licensing System**.

### 1 License = 1 Wallet

When you purchase a subscription, you are issued a unique **License Key**.

- This key maps directly to **one (1) specific wallet address**.
- The software will verify that the wallet currently configured in your LaserSell instance matches the wallet bound to your license key.
- Licenses are strictly **non-transferable between users** and are not intended to be shared.

### Managing Your License

We understand that security needs change and you may need to rotate wallets or keys. You have full control over your license via the **LaserSell Dashboard** ([app.lasersell.io](http://app.lasersell.io)).

- **Changing Your Wallet:** If you wish to trade with a different wallet, you can update the binded wallet address inside the dashboard. This takes effect immediately.
- **Rotating Your License Key:** If you believe your key has been compromised or simply wish to refresh it, you can generate a new License Key in the dashboard.
  - _Warning:_ Generating a new key will immediately **revoke** the previous key. Any running instances using the old key will cease to function until updated.

## System Requirements & Exclusions

To maintain the highest speed and lowest latency, LaserSell is a self-hosted solution. Please be aware of the following before purchasing:

1. **BYO Infrastructure:** The license fee covers the software only. It **does not** include a VPS (Virtual Private Server). You must host the application locally or on your own server.
2. **RPC Nodes:** High-speed trading requires high-speed data. A private RPC/gRPC endpoint is **not included** in the subscription and must be sourced separately to ensure optimal performance.

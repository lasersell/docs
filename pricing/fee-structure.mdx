A transparent breakdown of the costs associated with using the LaserSell platform.

LaserSell operates on a simple **Flat Fee** basis, enforced directly on-chain for maximum speed and transparency.

## 1. The Routing Fee (1% Flat)

We charge a flat **1% fee** on the total transaction value of every sell order executed through the LaserSell Router.

- **Simple & Predictable:** No complex profit calculations and no hidden spreads. You pay exactly 1% of the output volume.
- **On-Chain Enforcement:** The fee is handled atomically by the `LaserSell Router` smart contract. It is deducted automatically from the SOL proceeds during the transaction.

## 2. Network & Infrastructure Costs

To ensure your transactions land instantly there are two standard network costs involved. These are pass-through costs that go directly to the Solana network, not to us:

- **Jito Tip (Bribe):** A direct payment to validators to prioritize your transaction above others in the same block. You can customize this amount in your settings.
- **Solana Priority Fee:** A standard blockchain fee required to process high-priority computations on the network.

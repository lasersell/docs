title: "Fee Structure"
---

At LaserSell, our philosophy is simple: **We should only win when you win.**

Unlike traditional trading bots or swap platforms that charge a flat percentage on every single dollar you move (regardless of whether you lost money), LaserSell operates on a profit-first model. We specialize exclusively in the selling and closing of positions, ensuring our incentives are perfectly aligned with your success.

## 1. The Success Fee (5% of Profit Only)

This is our primary fee, and it applies **only when you leave a trade with more SOL than you started with.**

When you execute a profitable trade using LaserSell, we charge a **5% Success Fee** based strictly on your **Calculated Profit Estimate**.

- **How it works:** If you buy 10 SOL worth of a token and sell it for 15 SOL, your profit is 5 SOL. We charge 5% of that _profit_ (0.25 SOL).
- **The Difference:** Most competitors charge you based on the _total_ 15 SOL. We only charge based on the 5 SOL you gained.
- **Your Principal is Safe:** We never take a cut of your initial investment during a profitable trade.

## 2. The Safety Fee (0.7% Flat)

LaserSell provides advanced protection mechanisms, specifically **Stop Losses** and **Deadline Timeouts**, to protect your capital when a trade goes south.

If a trade is closed due to a Stop Loss or a Deadline Timeout (meaning the trade was likely break-even or a loss), the Success Fee is **waived**. Instead, a minimal **0.7% Safety Fee** is applied to the transaction value.

- **Why specific conditions?** This covers the infrastructure costs of monitoring your position while ensuring you don't pay high fees on trades that didn't go as planned.
- **Comparison:** This is significantly lower than the standard 1% fee most bots charge on _every_ loss.

## 3. Zero Buy Fees

Because LaserSell focuses exclusively on the art of the exit, **we charge 0% fees on your buy transactions.** You can buy using any platform you prefer, and rely on us solely for the execution of the sale.

## 4. Network & Infrastructure Costs

To ensure your transactions land instantly—beating other traders to the block—there are two standard network costs involved. These pass-through costs ensure your transaction priority:

- **Validator Acceleration Tip:** This is a direct payment to network validators (similar to a "bribe") to prioritize your transaction above others in the same block. This ensures your sell order isn't left pending while the price drops.
- **Solana Priority Fee:** A standard blockchain fee required to process high-priority computations on the network.

## Price Comparison: LaserSell vs. The Market

Most popular trading bots and wallets charge a flat fee on **every single transaction volume (Buy volume + Sell volume).** See how LaserSell compares to the major players.

### Real World Scenarios: How Much Do You Save?

Let's look at the math for two common trading scenarios compared to a standard trading bot (charging the industry average of 1%).

#### Scenario A: The Winning Trade 🚀

**You Buy 3 SOL and Sell for 3.5 SOL (0.5 SOL Profit)**

| Fee Breakdown   | Standard Trading Bot (1%) | LaserSell                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Buy Fee         | 0.03 SOL (1% of 3 SOL)    | **0 SOL** (Free)                    |
| Sell Fee        | 0.035 SOL (1% of 3.5 SOL) | **0.025 SOL** (5% of _Profit Only_) |
| Total Fees Paid | 0.065 SOL                 | **0.025 SOL**                       |
| Net Savings     | --                        | **You save ~61% on fees**           |

#### Scenario B: The Break-Even / Safety Stop 🛡️

**You Buy 3 SOL and Sell for 3 SOL (No Profit)**

| Fee Breakdown   | Standard Trading Bot (1%) | LaserSell                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Buy Fee         | 0.03 SOL (1% of 3 SOL)    | **0 SOL** (Free)                |
| Sell Fee        | 0.03 SOL (1% of 3 SOL)    | **0.021 SOL** (0.7% Safety Fee) |
| Total Fees Paid | 0.060 SOL                 | **0.021 SOL**                   |
| Net Savings     | --                        | **You save ~65% on fees**       |

### Why switch?

In high-frequency trading, fees eat your edge. By eliminating buy fees and only charging a premium when you actually succeed, LaserSell ensures your math is always better than the trader next to you.

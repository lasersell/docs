LaserSell is designed to be seamless. When your access period is nearing its end, you can extend your license duration without needing to reconfigure your bot or swap out license keys.

**How to Add Time to Your License**

1. **Visit the Purchase Page:** Go to [lasersell.io/buy](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://lasersell.io/buy).
2. **Select a Plan:** Choose either the **7 Day** or **30 Day** pass.
3. **Enter Your Email:** During checkout, you **must** enter the exact same email address you used for your original purchase.

**What Happens Next?** Our system will automatically detect the active license associated with that email address and credit the additional days to it.

- **No New Key Needed:** You do **not** need to generate or input a new license key.
- **Zero Downtime:** Your current license key will continue to function immediately with the new expiration date.

> **⚠️ Important:** If you use a different email address during checkout, the system will generate a brand new, separate license key instead of extending your existing one. Ensure your email matches exactly.

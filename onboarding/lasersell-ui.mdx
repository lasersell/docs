After you unlock your wallet (enter your keystore passphrase), LaserSell switches into its **Terminal UI (TUI)**. This screen is where you monitor detected tokens (“sessions”), see strategy settings, inspect a selected token in detail, and run commands.

## UI layout at a glance

The screen is split into four major areas:

![Screenshot2026 01 28at6 41 59AM](/images/Screenshot2026-01-28at6.41.59AM.png)

Two panes can take “focus”:

- **Sessions pane** (left) — for selecting tokens and UI shortcuts
- **Command pane** (bottom) — for typing commands

The focused pane is shown with a more prominent border highlight.

## Header bar

The header is a single-line status summary:

- **▶ RUNNING** / **⏸ PAUSED**
  - This controls **new sessions only**:
    - **RUNNING**: LaserSell can start new sessions when tokens are detected.
    - **PAUSED**: LaserSell will _not_ start new sessions (existing sessions keep running).
- **RPC _N_ ms**
  - Displays the most recent RPC latency measurement.
  - Color-coded in the UI:
    - fast (green), moderate (yellow), slow (red), or `--` if unknown
- **WS up/down**
  - Shows whether the Solana websocket stream is connected.
- **Wallet**
  - Shows your wallet pubkey in shortened form: `ABCD...WXYZ`
- **SOL**
  - Current SOL balance (if available)
- **USD1** / **USD1 (dev)**
  - Current USD1 balance (if available)
  - Shows “(dev)” when running on devnet

## Sessions panel (📈 Sessions)

This is the main list of tokens LaserSell has seen recently.

### Summary line

At the top of the panel you’ll see counters:

- **Active**: sessions currently running (not closed)
- **Pending**: detected but not yet started/filtered (roughly “in the pipeline”)
- **Detected**: total mints detected
- **Filtered**: mints rejected by filters

### List items

Each row looks like:

```shellscript
SYMBOL ABCD...WXYZ [STATUS] note…
```

- **SYMBOL**: token symbol if known, otherwise `(unknown)`
- **ABCD...WXYZ**: mint pubkey shortened
- **[STATUS]**: one of:

| Status label | Meaning                                                  |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DETECTED`   | Mint was detected (not yet filtered or started).         |
| `FILTERED`   | Mint was filtered out; note usually contains the reason. |
| `ACTIVE`     | A session started and is being tracked.                  |
| `SELL SCHED` | A sell has been scheduled (exit triggered).              |
| `SELLING`    | Sell attempts are in progress (may retry).               |
| `CLOSED`     | Session is closed (sold or otherwise ended).             |
| `ERROR`      | Session ended due to an error.                           |

- **note…**: short “last update” message (truncated in the list)

### Selection

- The currently selected mint is highlighted with a marker (shown as `▸` in the UI).
- The **Selected** panel on the right always shows details for the selected mint.

## Strategy panel (🎯 Strategy)

This panel shows the **currently active strategy settings** LaserSell is using:

- **TP**: Target Profit (percent)
- **SL**: Stop Loss (percent)
- **DEADLINE**:
  - `OFF` if disabled
  - otherwise shows the configured deadline timeout in seconds
- **SLIPPAGE**: max slippage allowed for sells (displayed as percent)

These values update immediately if you change them via the `set …` command (see below).

## Selected panel (🔎 Selected)

This panel shows details for the currently selected mint.

### Basic fields

- **Token:** Identity line
  - Shows `SYMBOL - Name` when available
  - Falls back to symbol-only, name-only, or the mint short id
- **State:** Session phase/state

Session phase values you may see:

| Phase label      | Meaning                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `DETECTING`      | Session started; still resolving initial details.   |
| `COST BASIS`     | Cost basis has been computed/resolved.              |
| `HOLDING`        | Position is held and monitored for exit conditions. |
| `SELL SCHEDULED` | Exit triggered; sell is queued/scheduled.           |
| `SELLING`        | Sell attempts are actively executing.               |
| `CLOSED`         | Sell completed / session closed.                    |
| `ERROR`          | Session failed and closed.                          |

### Position and execution fields (when a session is active)

You may see:

- **Cost basis:** what LaserSell measured as the buy amount (in quote units)
  - **Requested:** shown when available (what was requested vs. what was actually spent)
- **Tokens:** size of the position (token count) if available
- **Market / Quote:**
  - Market values include: `pumpfun`, `pumpswap`, `meteora_dbc`, `meteora_damm_v2`, `raydium_launchpad`, `raydium_cpmm`
  - Quote values include: `SOL`, `USD1`, or `OTHER`
- **Proceeds:** estimated proceeds if the position were sold at current conditions
- **PnL:** `proceeds - cost_basis` (colored)
  - Also shows percent PnL when cost basis is known
- **Deadline remaining:**
  - `OFF` if deadline disabled
  - otherwise the remaining time until the deadline triggers

### Sell attempt fields (when selling or after a sell)

- **Sell:** attempt number, slippage used for that attempt, and retry count

### Expanded diagnostics (toggle on/off)

Press **Enter** while focused on the Sessions pane to toggle “expanded details”. When expanded, the Selected panel can include:

- **Token program** and **Token account** (short ids)
- **Fee bps** and **P95 down/slot** (diagnostic metrics)
- **Curve complete** (yes/no/unknown)
- **Last update age**
- **Last sell error** (truncated)
- **Last signature** (shortened)

These are primarily for troubleshooting / support context.

### Progress to TP gauge

At the bottom is a gauge labeled **Progress to TP**.

- It estimates how close the selected session is to hitting your configured target profit.
- It’s based on **current estimated proceeds vs. cost basis vs. target-profit amount**.
- If data isn’t available yet, it will show `0%`.

## Output panel (logs + responses)

This is a rolling feed of:

- your typed commands
- LaserSell replies (success/info/warn/error)
- surfaced log events (when relevant)

Line prefixes:

- `❯` command you typed
- `✓` success reply
- `↳` informational reply
- `⚠` warning
- `✖` error

Use `clear` to wipe this panel.

## Command input panel (❯ Command)

This is where you type commands.

- When empty, it shows a hint like: `Type a command… (? for help)`
- When focused, a cursor block is shown.

Editing / history:

- **Enter**: run the command
- **Esc**: clear the command line (and cancels pending confirmations)
- **Up/Down**: browse command history
- **Backspace**: delete

## Keyboard controls

### Global

- **Ctrl+C**: quit immediately
- **Tab / Shift+Tab**: toggle focus between:
  - Sessions pane
  - Command pane

### Sessions pane (left) controls

These only work when the **Sessions** pane is focused:

- **Up / Down**: move selection
- **Enter**: toggle expanded details in the Selected panel
- **Space**: pause/resume **new sessions**
- **m**: toggle mouse capture (enables/disables mouse interaction)

## Mouse controls

Mouse interaction only works when:

1. Sessions pane is focused, and
2. mouse capture is enabled

Supported actions:

- **Left click** on a session row: select that mint
- **Scroll wheel**: move selection up/down
- **Left click** on the RUNNING/PAUSED area in the header: toggle pause/resume
- **Left click** in the output or command area: focus the command input (and mouse capture will be released)

## Command reference

Type these in the **Command** panel and press Enter.

### `help` / `?`

Prints the built-in help list (the available commands).

Example:

```shellscript
help
```

### `quit` / `exit` / `q`

Quits the TUI (same end result as Ctrl+C).

Example:

```shellscript
q
```

### `pause`

Pauses **new sessions** (does not stop existing ones).

Example:

```shellscript
pause
```

If already paused, it will tell you.

### `resume`

Resumes starting new sessions.

Example:

```shellscript
resume
```

If already running, it will tell you.

### `sell` / `s`

Queues an immediate sell for the **currently selected mint**.

Behavior:

- Requires confirmation.
- After you run `sell`, you must type `y` (or `yes`) quickly to confirm.
- If you type `n`/`no`, it cancels.
- The confirmation prompt times out very quickly (a couple seconds). If it times out, re-run `sell`.

Example flow:

```shellscript
sell
y
```

If no session is selected, it warns you.

### `extension code`

Requests a new pairing code (for telemetry/extension pairing) **only if telemetry is enabled in your config**.

Example:

```shellscript
extension code
```

What you’ll see:

- An info line that it’s requesting a code
- Then output lines like:
  - `Pairing code: …`
  - `Expires at: …`

If telemetry is disabled, it will warn you.

### `set …` (live settings)

Updates strategy/sell settings **and writes them to your config file automatically**, then applies them live (no restart required).

Supported forms:

- `set tp <percent>`
- `set sl <percent>`
- `set slippage <percent>`
- `set timeout <seconds>`

Examples:

```shellscript
set tp 6%
set sl 0%
set slippage 20%
set timeout 45
```

Notes:

- `tp` and `sl` require a percent string like `6%` (include the `%`).
- `slippage` accepts percent input and is converted internally (1% = 100 bps).
- `timeout` is whole seconds:
  - `0` disables the deadline timeout.

If LaserSell can’t load or write the config, it will print an error.

### `clear`

Clears the Output panel (does not affect sessions).

Example:

```shellscript
clear
```

## Common operational notes

- If `sell` says “No session selected,” focus the Sessions pane (Tab), pick a mint (Up/Down or mouse), then try again.
- If you want to copy text from your terminal and mouse selection isn’t working, toggle mouse capture off (`m`) while focused on the Sessions pane.
- If the Selected panel shows `--` values, the session likely hasn’t resolved that data yet (cost basis/position tokens/proceeds update over time).

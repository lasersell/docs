Lasersell supports standard Solana bonding curve protocols. We currently only support pairs using **SOL** as the quote currency.

### Supported Protocols

- [**Pump.fun**](http://Pump.fun)
- [**Bags.fm**](http://Bags.fm)
- _General support for any token launching via Meteora's Dynamic Bonding Curve standard._

### Supported Assets

- **Quote Currency:** SOL only.

**_Note: We do not currently support stablecoin pairs (e.g., USDC, USD1) or other AMM structures (e.g., Raydium, Bonk.fun)._**

### Roadmap

We are actively expanding Lasersell's compatibility layer. Planned future support includes:

- **New Quote Currencies:** USD1 and USDC pairs.
- **Additional Protocols:** [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun) and standard Raydium pools.
- **Multi-Chain Integration:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC) support.

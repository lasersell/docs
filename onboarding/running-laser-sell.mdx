LaserSell is a command-line application designed to run on high-performance Linux VPS environments. While the application handles complex high-frequency trading logic, its runtime behavior is controlled by a set of command-line arguments passed at startup.

These arguments allow you to define the bot's strategy (deployer vs. trader), its interface (GUI vs. headless), and its target configuration.

## Core Strategy Arguments

The most important arguments determine **what** LaserSell watches and trades. You can choose to manage coins you create, coins others create, or specific targets.

`-c` / `--create`

- **Target Audience:** High-frequency memecoin deployers.
- **Function:** Monitors the blockchain for new mints where the **creator address matches your wallet address**.
- **Why use it:** This allows you to manage the exit strategy for your _own_ projects. You deploy and fund the token using your external tools; LaserSell detects the new asset in your wallet immediately upon creation and automates the selling process based on your parameters.

`-l` / `--live`

- **Target Audience:** High-frequency traders & sell snipers.
- **Function:** Monitors the blockchain for new mints where the **creator address is NOT your wallet**.
- **Why use it:** This turns LaserSell into an automated "exit manager" for public launches. You use a separate sniper bot or wallet to buy the token externally; LaserSell detects your entry into the position and immediately takes over to manage the stops and profit-taking.

> **Note:** You can combine `-c` and `-l` to run a hybrid strategy. This configures the bot to manage exits for your own deployments while simultaneously watching for your external buys on public markets.

`-m <MINT_ADDRESS>` / `--mint <MINT_ADDRESS>`

- **Target Audience:** Targeted single-token traders.
- **Function:** Puts LaserSell into "Single-Mint Mode." Instead of scanning for new tokens, it focuses entirely on the specific contract address (Mint ID) provided.
- **Why use it:** Use this when you have already bought (or are about to buy) a specific token using an external tool. LaserSell locks onto this specific mint and waits for your balance to appear, then manages the sale.
  - \_Note: This option is mutually exclusive with **`-cand _ -l.`**

## Configuration & Interface Arguments

These arguments control how the application loads and how it displays information.

`-f <PATH>` / `--config <PATH>`

- **Description:** Manually specifies the path to your `config.yml` file.
  - **Default Behavior:** If omitted, LaserSell looks for the config in standard system directories (e.g., `~/.lasersell/config.yml`) .
  - **Why use it:** Essential if you run multiple bot instances with different strategies (e.g., one config for conservative exits, one for aggressive "degen" plays).

`--setup`

- **Description:** Launches the interactive setup wizard in the plain terminal.
  - **Why use it:** Run this the first time you install LaserSell on a fresh VPS. It walks you through generating a config file, importing keys, and setting RPC endpoints without needing to manually edit YAML files.

`--no-tui`

- **Description:** Disables the Terminal User Interface (TUI) and runs in "Headless" mode.
  - **Why use it:** This is standard for production servers. It prevents the graphical dashboard from loading, instead outputting standard logs to stdout. This is required if you are running LaserSell as a background service (systemd) or piping logs to a file.

`-v` / `--verbose`

- **Description:** Enables verbose logging and automatically disables the TUI.
  - **Why use it:** Use this for debugging. If the bot isn't reacting to your external buys as expected, this flag ensures all debug-level logs are printed directly to the console so you can trace the detection events.

## Common Usage Examples

**1. The "Deployer" Bot** Managing exits for your own launches with a specific configuration file.

```bash
lasersell -f ./my-launches.yml -c
```

**2. The "Sell Sniper" Bot (Headless)** Running in the background to manage exits on public tokens you buy externally.

```bash
lasersell --no-tui -l
```

**3. The "Hybrid" Dashboard** Running with the visual dashboard to monitor and manage exits for both your own launches and public market buys.

```bash
lasersell -c -l
```

**4. First Time Setup** Initializing the bot on a new server.

```bash
lasersell --setup
```

LaserSell is designed to get you up and running quickly. Instead of manually writing configuration files from scratch, the application includes an **Interactive Setup Wizard** that runs the first time you launch it.

## 1. Initial Setup (The Wizard)

After you have created or imported your wallet (see [LaserSell Wallet](https://www.google.com/search?q=/onboarding/laser-sell-wallet)), the wizard will automatically proceed to the **Configuration** phase.

This interactive process configures your connectivity to the Solana network. You will be prompted for the following inputs in your terminal:

### Step 1: License Activation

The first prompt asks for your license key.

- **Input:** Paste your LaserSell license key here.
- **Note:** The key is validated immediately. You cannot proceed without a valid license.

### Step 2: RPC Connection

The wizard asks how you want to **send transactions** and fetch account data.

- **Use private RPC? [y/N]**:
  - **No (Default/Recommended):** Uses **Helius**. You will be asked for your Helius API key later.
  - **Yes:** Select this if you have your own private node. You will be prompted to enter your HTTP/HTTPS URL.
- **Use public RPC?**: (Only appears if you declined private RPC). We recommend choosing **No** to stick with Helius, as public RPCs are often too slow for sniping.

### Step 3: Stream Connection

The wizard asks how you want to **receive market data** (new mints, price updates).

- **Use Laserstream? [y/N]**:
  - **Yes:** Uses the proprietary low-latency Laserstream backend. This requires a Helius Pro Plan.
  - **No:** Uses standard WebSockets.
- **Stream Source:** If you aren't using Laserstream, you can choose to stream data via Helius (recommended), a Private Node, or Public nodes.

### Step 4: Credentials

- **Helius API Key:** If you selected Helius for RPC or Streaming, you must paste your API Key here.
- **Private URLs:** If you selected Private modes, you will need to paste your RPC (HTTP) and WebSocket (WSS) URLs.

Once finished, the wizard saves a `config.yml` file and an encrypted keystore to your disk.

## 2. The Configuration File

While the wizard handles connectivity, it applies **default safety settings** for your trading strategy (e.g., Take Profit at 0.2 SOL, Stop Loss at 0.1 SOL).

To customize your strategy, change slippage settings, or enable telemetry, you must edit the generated `config.yml` file.

Open the file in your text editor:

```bash
nano config.yml
```

### Strategy Section (Important)

This controls when LaserSell exits a position. You likely want to change these defaults to match your risk profile.

```bash
strategy:
  target_profit: 0.2        # or "50%"
  stop_loss: 0.1            # or "25%"
  sell_all_timeout_sec: 30
```

- `target_profit`:
  - **SOL Amount:** Enter a number (e.g., `0.5`) to sell when profit exceeds that amount in SOL.
  - **Percentage:** Enter a string (e.g., `"100%"`) to sell when the position value doubles (2x).
- `stop_loss`:
  - **SOL Amount:** Enter a number (e.g., `0.1`) to sell if you lose that amount in SOL.
  - **Percentage:** Enter a string (e.g., `"20%"`) to sell if the value drops 20% below your entry price.
- `sell_all_timeout_sec`: A hard time limit. If a trade is still open after this many seconds, LaserSell will exit immediately to free up your capital.

### Sell Execution

Controls the safety parameters for sell transactions.

```bash
sell:
  slippage_pad_bps: 20      # Buffer added to calculated slippage (0.20%)
  slippage_max_bps: 2000    # Hard cap on slippage (20.00%)
  confirm_timeout_sec: 10   # How long to wait for confirmation
  max_retries: 2            # Retries if a sell fails
```

### Telemetry

To use the Chrome Extension dashboard, ensure telemetry is enabled.

```bash
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```

## 3. Applying Changes

If you edit the `config.yml` file while LaserSell is running, the changes will **not** take effect immediately. You must restart the application:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop LaserSell.
2. Run `lasersell` again.

Your new settings will be loaded on startup.

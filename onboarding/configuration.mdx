LaserSell is designed to get you up and running quickly. Instead of manually writing configuration files from scratch, the application includes an Interactive Setup Wizard that runs the first time you launch it.

### 1. Initial Setup (The Wizard)

When you launch LaserSell without a configuration file, the **LaserSell Setup** wizard will guide you through the following steps in your terminal.

#### Step 1: RPC Selection

The wizard asks how you want to send transactions and fetch account data. Select a number from the menu:

1. **Helius (Recommended):** Uses Helius RPC. You will be prompted for your API key.
2. **Private Node:** Uses your own node. You will be prompted for your private RPC URL (must start with `https://`).
3. **Public Node:** Uses public Solana RPCs.

#### Step 2: Stream Selection

Select a provider for detecting tokens and receiving market data:

1. **Helius WS (Standard):** Standard WebSocket connection.
3. **Private WS:** Connects to your private WebSocket URL (must start with `wss://`).
4. **Public WS (Slowest):** Uses public WebSockets.

#### Step 3: Strategy

Configure your initial trading parameters. You can input values in SOL (e.g., `0.2`) or as a percentage of the buy amount (e.g., `50%`).

- **Target Profit:** The amount or percentage at which to take profit.
- **Enable Stop Loss? [Y/n]:**
  - If **Yes**, you will enter the **Stop Loss** amount (SOL or %).
- **Sell Timeout (seconds):** How long to keep a position open before force-selling (default: 120s).
- **Slippage Tolerance:** Max slippage in basis points (e.g., `2000` = 20%).

#### Step 4: Wallet

The wizard handles wallet setup directly. You will be asked: **"Import an existing wallet? [y/N]"**.

- **No (Create New):** Generates a new wallet. The 12-word seed phrase and Public Key will be displayed. **Save your seed phrase immediately**, then confirm to proceed.
- **Yes (Import):** Choose an import method:
  1. **Seed phrase:** Enter your 12 or 24-word mnemonic.
  2. **Solana keypair JSON path:** Path to a standard Solana keypair file.
  3. **Base58 secret key:** Paste the raw private key string.

#### Step 5: Security

- **Keystore Passphrase:** Set a password to encrypt your wallet file. This password will be required every time you start LaserSell.

#### Step 6: Files

Confirm where to save your data:

- **Config file location:** Default is `config.yml`.
- **Keystore file location:** Default is `wallet.keystore.json`.

#### Step 7: Review

A summary of your settings (Strategy, RPC, Stream, Wallet, and File paths) will be displayed.

- **Write configuration now? [y/N]:** Type `y` to save files and complete setup.

### 2. The Configuration File

After the wizard completes, a `config.yml` file is created containing the settings you chose. To modify your strategy later without re-running the wizard, edit this file directly.

Open the file in your text editor: `nano config.yml`

**To save your changes in Nano:**

1. Press `Ctrl + O` to write the file.
2. Press `Enter` to confirm the filename.
3. Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

#### Strategy Section

This controls when LaserSell exits a position.

```yaml
strategy:
  target_profit: 0.2          # 0.2 SOL profit
  stop_loss: "20%"            # Stop loss at 20% drop
  sell_all_timeout_sec: 120   # Force sell after 120 seconds
```

- **target_profit / stop_loss:**
  - **SOL Amount:** Enter a number (e.g., `0.5`) to sell when profit/loss hits that specific SOL value.
  - **Percentage:** Enter a string (e.g., `"100%"`) to sell based on a percentage of your entry price.
  - To disable Stop Loss manually, set it to `0`.

#### Sell Execution

Controls the safety parameters for sell transactions.

```yaml
sell:
  slippage_pad_bps: 40      # Extra buffer added to calculated slippage (0.40%)
  slippage_max_bps: 2000    # Hard cap on slippage (20.00%)
  confirm_timeout_sec: 10   # How long to wait for confirmation (Mainnet default)
  max_retries: 2            # Retries if a sell fails
```

#### Telemetry

To use the Chrome Extension dashboard, ensure telemetry is enabled.

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: true
```

### 3. Applying Changes

If you edit `config.yml` while LaserSell is running, you must restart the application for changes to take effect:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop LaserSell.
2. Run `lasersell` again.

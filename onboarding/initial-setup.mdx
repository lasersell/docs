description: "Step-by-step guide to the interactive onboarding wizard that creates your config and encrypted wallet keystore."
---

LaserSell includes an interactive setup wizard that runs automatically the first time you launch `lasersell` (when no config exists). You can also run it any time with:

```shellscript
lasersell --setup
```

This page is a walkthrough of **the wizard prompts in the exact order you'll see them**, with explanations of what each choice means.

> **Scope:** This page covers **only** the interactive onboarding wizard flow. It does **not** cover manually editing the config file.

## What the wizard creates

By the end of the wizard, LaserSell will create (or reuse) two local files:

- **Config file** (YAML): stores your RPC, API key, strategy settings, and points to your wallet file.
- **Wallet keystore** (JSON): an **encrypted** wallet file that LaserSell uses to sign transactions.

By default these live in:

- `~/.lasersell/config.yml`
- `~/.lasersell/wallet.keystore.json`

(If you choose a custom config path, the keystore default is placed next to it.)

## Before you start

Have these ready:

- **RPC URL** — a private HTTPS RPC endpoint (e.g. from [Helius](https://helius.dev) or [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com))
- **LaserSell API key** — get one free at [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io)
- **Wallet plan**
  - Creating a new wallet: a safe place to store a new seed phrase
  - Importing: either your **seed phrase**, a **base58 secret key**, or a **Solana keypair JSON file**
- An **interactive terminal**
  - The wizard requires a real TTY. Don't run it through a non-interactive service/pipe.

## How to answer wizard prompts

- Prompts often show a default like: `Enter choice [1]:`
  - Press **Enter** to accept the default.
- Yes/No prompts appear as:
  - `[Y/n]` → default is **Yes** (Enter = yes)
  - `[y/N]` → default is **No** (Enter = no)
- Some sensitive inputs (API key, seed phrase, base58 secret key, passphrase) are **masked** (you won't see what you type). That's expected.

## Step 0: Recommended settings

You'll first see:

- `Use recommended settings? (skips strategy + file path questions) [Y/n]:`

### If you choose **Yes** (recommended)

- Skips the **Strategy** input questions (applies defaults automatically)
- Skips the **file path** questions (uses defaults)
- Uses a **safer "confirm write" default** (it will default to writing the config)

Recommended strategy defaults applied:

- **Take Profit:** 6%
- **Stop Loss:** 10%
- **Trailing Stop:** 0% (disabled)
- **Deadline:** 120 seconds
- **Slippage:** 20.00%
- **Sell on Graduation:** off

### If you choose **No**

You'll be prompted to enter:

- Strategy values (take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, deadline, slippage, sell on graduation)
- Config and keystore file locations

## Step 1: Credentials & Network

### RPC URL

Prompt:

- `RPC URL (private recommended):`

Placeholder: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`

What it means:

- This is the Solana RPC endpoint LaserSell will use for all on-chain operations.
- A private RPC (from Helius, Chainstack, QuickNode, etc.) is strongly recommended for speed and reliability.
- Must start with `https://` (or `http://` only for localhost/local development).

You can leave it empty to use the default public endpoint, but this is **not recommended** for production trading.

### LaserSell API key

Prompt:

- `LaserSell API key:`

What it means:

- Required field — cannot be empty.
- Get a free API key at [app.lasersell.io](https://app.lasersell.io).
- Input is masked (won't echo).

## Step 2: Strategy

If you selected **recommended settings**, LaserSell applies defaults and moves on.

If not, you'll be asked these questions:

### Target profit

Prompt:

- `Enable Target Profit? [Y/n]:`

If **Yes**:

- `Target Profit (% of buy) [6%]:`

**Input format:** must be a **percent**, like `6%` or `10%`.

What it means:

- LaserSell will sell when your profit reaches this percent of the detected buy cost.

Constraints:

- Must be **greater than 0%**.

### Stop loss

Prompt:

- `Enable Stop Loss? [Y/n]:`

If **Yes**:

- `Stop Loss (% of buy) [10%]:`

**Input format:** percent, like `5%`.

What it means:

- LaserSell will sell if losses reach this percent of the detected buy cost.

### Trailing stop

Prompt:

- `Enable Trailing Stop? [y/N]:`

If **Yes**:

- `Trailing Stop (% of buy) [5%]:`

**Input format:** percent, like `5%`.

What it means:

- LaserSell tracks the peak profit of a position. If the price drops by this percent of entry from the peak, it triggers a sell.
- Useful for letting winners run while still protecting gains.

Constraints:

- Must be **greater than 0%** when enabled.

### Deadline timeout

Prompt:

- `Enable Deadline Timeout? [Y/n]:`

If **Yes**:

- `Deadline Timeout (seconds) [45]:`

What it means:

- A hard time limit. If the position is still open when this time expires, LaserSell force-sells.
- `0` disables the deadline entirely.

### Important: at least one exit must be enabled

At least one of target profit, stop loss, trailing stop, or deadline timeout must be enabled. If you disable all four, the wizard will loop and ask you to enable at least one.

### Slippage tolerance

Prompt:

- `Slippage Tolerance (%) [20%]:`

**Input format:** percent, like `20%` (not basis points).

What it means:

- Caps how much slippage LaserSell will tolerate during sell execution.
- Higher = more likely to execute quickly; worse prices are possible.

### Sell on graduation

Prompt:

- `Auto-sell when token graduates to a new DEX? [y/N]:`

What it means:

- When enabled, LaserSell will automatically sell your position when the token migrates from a bonding curve to a DEX (e.g. Pump.fun → PumpSwap).
- Default is **No**.

## Step 3: Wallet

This step decides what wallet LaserSell will use to monitor buys and execute sells.

### If an encrypted keystore is detected

If LaserSell finds an existing encrypted keystore file, you'll see something like:

- `Existing keystore detected: ...`
- `Use existing wallet and keep the current keystore file? [Y/n]:`

If you choose **Yes**:

- LaserSell will **reuse** that wallet file (it will not rewrite it).
- You'll unlock it in **Step 4**.

If you choose **No**:

- You'll proceed to create/import a different wallet.

### If no keystore is detected (or you chose not to reuse it)

You'll be asked:

- `Import an existing wallet? [y/N]:`

#### If you choose **No** (create new wallet)

LaserSell will:

- Generate a new **12-word seed phrase**
- Display it **once**
- Show the derived **wallet pubkey**

You must confirm:

- `I have saved this seed phrase. Continue? [y/N]:`

> **You will not be shown the seed phrase again.** If you lose it, you lose the wallet.

#### If you choose **Yes** (import existing wallet)

You'll choose an import method:

1. **Private key (base58)**
2. **Seed phrase**
3. **Solana keypair JSON path**

After import, LaserSell will show:

- `Derived wallet pubkey: ...`
- `Use this wallet? [Y/n]:`

Always verify the pubkey is the wallet you intended before continuing.

##### Import method: Private key (base58)

Prompt:

- `Base58 secret key:`

Notes:

- This must be the **private key**, not the public address.
- Input is masked (won't echo).

##### Import method: Seed phrase

Prompt:

- `Seed phrase:`

Notes:

- Uses the standard Solana derivation path: `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`
- Input is masked (won't echo)
- If the derived pubkey doesn't match what you expect, your wallet may be using a different derivation setup—use another import method.

##### Import method: Solana keypair JSON file

Prompt:

- `Solana keypair JSON path:`

Notes:

- This is the typical Solana `id.json` style keypair file.
- After you confirm the wallet, LaserSell may ask:
  - `Delete the plaintext keypair JSON file after it's imported? [y/N]:`

If you answer **Yes**, LaserSell will attempt to delete that plaintext file after it has safely imported and encrypted the wallet.

> A plaintext keypair JSON file is a raw private key on disk. Treat it as compromised until deleted.

## Step 4: Security

This step controls wallet encryption access.

### If you are reusing an existing keystore

You'll be asked to unlock it:

- `Keystore passphrase:`

You'll be re-prompted until the passphrase is correct.

### If you are creating/importing a new wallet

You'll set a new keystore passphrase:

- `Keystore passphrase:`
- `Confirm passphrase:`

Rules:

- Cannot be empty
- Must match exactly

> If you forget this passphrase, LaserSell cannot decrypt the keystore. Your recovery path is re-importing the wallet (seed phrase/private key) and creating a new keystore.

## Step 5: Files

This step is about where LaserSell saves the two files.

### Recommended settings mode

- Uses the config path LaserSell is running with (default: `~/.lasersell/config.yml`)
- Uses a keystore file next to it (default: `wallet.keystore.json`)
- You won't be prompted unless something must be resolved (like overwrite conflicts).

### Custom mode

You will be prompted for:

- `Config file location [<default>]:`
- `Keystore file location [<default>]:`

Defaults:

- Config defaults to the path LaserSell is currently using.
- Keystore defaults to `wallet.keystore.json` in the same directory as the config.

## Step 6: Review and write

LaserSell prints a summary like:

- Strategy (take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, deadline, sell on graduation)
- RPC URL
- API key (masked)
- Wallet pubkey (shortened)
- File names

### Overwrite prompts

If the target config or keystore already exists, LaserSell will ask before overwriting:

- `Config file <path> exists. Overwrite? [y/N]:`
- `Keystore file <path> exists. Overwrite? [y/N]:`

Behavior to know:

- Default is **No**.
- If you answer **No**:
  - In **custom mode**, you'll be asked to enter a different path.
  - In **recommended mode**, the wizard will stop and tell you to rerun without recommended settings if you want different file locations.

### Final prompt: write configuration

Prompt:

- `Write configuration now?`

Defaults:

- **Recommended mode:** defaults to **Yes**
- **Custom mode:** defaults to **No** (you must type `y` to write)

If you do not write, the wizard exits without saving.

## What happens after "Setup complete"

After setup, LaserSell continues into normal startup:

- If you created/imported a wallet, it will use the encrypted keystore going forward.
- On future launches, LaserSell will require the **keystore passphrase** to unlock the wallet (unless you've set up an automated passphrase flow for headless runs via the `LASERSELL_WALLET_PASSPHRASE` env var).

## Common issues

### "config file not found; run --setup in an interactive terminal"

You're launching LaserSell without a config **in a non-interactive environment** (no TTY). Fix:

1. SSH into the machine (or open a local terminal)
2. Run the wizard once:

   ```shellscript
   lasersell --setup
   ```
3. Then run headless/service mode using the generated config.

### My imported seed phrase gives the "wrong" wallet address

LaserSell derives using Solana's standard derivation path (`m/44'/501'/0'/0'`) and no additional BIP-39 passphrase. If your wallet uses a different setup, import via **base58 secret key** or **keypair JSON** instead.

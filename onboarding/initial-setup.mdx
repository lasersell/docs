description: "Step-by-step guide to the interactive onboarding wizard that creates your config and encrypted wallet keystore."
---

LaserSell includes an interactive setup wizard that runs automatically the first time you launch `lasersell` (when no config exists). You can also run it any time with:

```shellscript
lasersell --setup
```

This page is a walkthrough of **the wizard prompts in the exact order you’ll see them**, with explanations of what each choice means.

> **Scope:** This page covers **only** the interactive onboarding wizard flow. It does **not** cover manually editing the config file.

## What the wizard creates

By the end of the wizard, LaserSell will create (or reuse) two local files:

- **Config file** (YAML): stores your chosen RPC/WebSocket/strategy settings and points to your wallet file.
- **Wallet keystore** (JSON): an **encrypted** wallet file that LaserSell uses to sign transactions.

By default these live in:

- `~/.lasersell/config.yml`
- `~/.lasersell/wallet.keystore.json`

(If you choose a custom config path, the keystore default is placed next to it.)

## Before you start

Have these ready:

- **RPC / WebSocket choice**
  - Helius: your **Helius API key**
  - Private providers: your **HTTPS RPC URL** and/or **WSS WebSocket URL**
- **Wallet plan**
  - Creating a new wallet: a safe place to store a new seed phrase
  - Importing: either your **seed phrase**, a **base58 secret key**, or a **Solana keypair JSON file**
- An **interactive terminal**
  - The wizard requires a real TTY. Don’t run it through a non-interactive service/pipe.

## How to answer wizard prompts

- Prompts often show a default like: `Enter choice [1]:`
  - Press **Enter** to accept the default.
- Yes/No prompts appear as:
  - `[Y/n]` → default is **Yes** (Enter = yes)
  - `[y/N]` → default is **No** (Enter = no)
- Some sensitive inputs (seed phrase, base58 secret key, passphrase) are **masked** (you won’t see what you type). That’s expected.

## Step 0: Recommended settings

You’ll first see:

- `Use recommended settings? (skips strategy + file path questions) [Y/n]:`

### If you choose **Yes** (recommended)

- Skips the **Strategy** input questions (applies defaults automatically)
- Skips the **file path** questions (uses defaults)
- Uses a **safer “confirm write” default** (it will default to writing the config)

Recommended strategy defaults applied:

- **Take Profit:** 6%
- **Stop Loss:** disabled
- **Deadline:** 45 seconds
- **Slippage:** 20.00%

### If you choose **No**

You’ll be prompted to enter:

- Strategy values (take profit, stop loss, deadline, slippage)
- Config and keystore file locations

## Step 1: RPC selection

Prompt:

- `Select RPC Provider (for sending transactions):`
  1. `Helius (Recommended)`
  2. `Private Node`
  3. `Public Node`

### 1) Helius (Recommended)

- You’ll be prompted for: `Helius API key`
- Best default for most users.

### 2) Private Node

- You’ll be prompted for: `Private RPC URL (start with https://)`
- **Must** start with `https://`
- `http://` is rejected (insecure)

### 3) Public Node

- No additional input
- Typically the least reliable under load.

## Step 2: WebSocket selection

Prompt:

- `Select Websocket Provider (for detecting tokens):`
  1. `Helius Websocket (Standard, requires Dev plan)`
  2. `Private Websocket (Chainstack/QuickNode/etc)`
  3. `Public Websocket (Slowest)`

### 1) Helius WebSocket

- Uses Helius for token detection / streaming.
- If you didn’t enter a Helius API key in Step 1, it will ask for it here.

### 2) Private WebSocket

- You’ll be prompted for: `Private Websocket URL (start with wss://)`
- **Must** start with `wss://`
- `ws://` and `http://` are rejected (insecure)

### 3) Public WebSocket

- No additional input
- Slowest / least reliable for fast token detection.

## Step 3: Strategy

If you selected **recommended settings**, LaserSell applies defaults and moves on.

If not, you’ll be asked these questions:

### Target profit

Prompt:

- `Target Profit (% of buy) [6%]:`

**Input format:** must be a **percent**, like `6%` or `10%`.

What it means:

- LaserSell will sell when your profit reaches this percent of the detected buy cost.

Constraints:

- Must be **greater than 0%**.

### Stop loss

Prompt:

- `Enable Stop Loss? [Y/n]:`

If **Yes**, you’ll be asked:

- `Stop Loss (% of buy) [0%]:`

**Input format:** percent, like `5%`.

What it means:

- LaserSell will sell if losses reach this percent of the detected buy cost.

Important behavior:

- `0%` effectively disables stop loss (even if you answered “Yes”).

### Deadline timeout

Prompt:

- `Deadline Timeout (seconds, 0 disables) [45]:`

What it means:

- A hard time limit. If the position is still open when this time expires, LaserSell force-sells.

Notes:

- `0` disables the deadline entirely.

### Slippage tolerance

Prompt:

- `Slippage Tolerance (%) [20%]:`

**Input format:** percent, like `20%` (not basis points).

What it means:

- Caps how much slippage LaserSell will tolerate during sell execution.
- Higher = more likely to execute quickly; worse prices are possible.

## Step 4: Wallet

This step decides what wallet LaserSell will use to monitor buys and execute sells.

### If an encrypted keystore is detected

If LaserSell finds an existing encrypted keystore file, you’ll see something like:

- `Existing keystore detected: ...`
- `Use existing wallet and keep the current keystore file? [Y/n]:`

If you choose **Yes**:

- LaserSell will **reuse** that wallet file (it will not rewrite it).
- You’ll unlock it in **Step 5**.

If you choose **No**:

- You’ll proceed to create/import a different wallet.

### If no keystore is detected (or you chose not to reuse it)

You’ll be asked:

- `Import an existing wallet? [y/N]:`

#### If you choose **No** (create new wallet)

LaserSell will:

- Generate a new **12-word seed phrase**
- Display it **once**
- Show the derived **wallet pubkey**

You must confirm:

- `I have saved this seed phrase. Continue? [y/N]:`

> **You will not be shown the seed phrase again.** If you lose it, you lose the wallet.

#### If you choose **Yes** (import existing wallet)

You’ll choose an import method:

1. **Private key (base58)**
2. **Seed phrase**
3. **Solana keypair JSON path**

After import, LaserSell will show:

- `Derived wallet pubkey: ...`
- `Use this wallet? [Y/n]:`

Always verify the pubkey is the wallet you intended before continuing.

##### Import method: Private key (base58)

Prompt:

- `Base58 secret key:`

Notes:

- This must be the **private key**, not the public address.
- Input is masked (won’t echo).

##### Import method: Seed phrase

Prompt:

- `Seed phrase:`

Notes:

- Uses the standard Solana derivation path: `m/44'/501'/0'/0'`
- Input is masked (won’t echo)
- If the derived pubkey doesn’t match what you expect, your wallet may be using a different derivation setup—use another import method.

##### Import method: Solana keypair JSON file

Prompt:

- `Solana keypair JSON path:`

Notes:

- This is the typical Solana `id.json` style keypair file.
- After you confirm the wallet, LaserSell may ask:
  - `Delete the plaintext keypair JSON file after it's imported? [y/N]:`

If you answer **Yes**, LaserSell will attempt to delete that plaintext file after it has safely imported and encrypted the wallet.

> A plaintext keypair JSON file is a raw private key on disk. Treat it as compromised until deleted.

## Step 5: Security

This step controls wallet encryption access.

### If you are reusing an existing keystore

You’ll be asked to unlock it:

- `Keystore passphrase:`

You’ll be re-prompted until the passphrase is correct.

### If you are creating/importing a new wallet

You’ll set a new keystore passphrase:

- `Keystore passphrase:`
- `Confirm passphrase:`

Rules:

- Cannot be empty
- Must match exactly

> If you forget this passphrase, LaserSell cannot decrypt the keystore. Your recovery path is re-importing the wallet (seed phrase/private key) and creating a new keystore.

## Step 6: Files

This step is about where LaserSell saves the two files.

### Recommended settings mode

- Uses the config path LaserSell is running with (default: `~/.lasersell/config.yml`)
- Uses a keystore file next to it (default: `wallet.keystore.json`)
- You won’t be prompted unless something must be resolved (like overwrite conflicts).

### Custom mode

You will be prompted for:

- `Config file location [<default>]:`
- `Keystore file location [<default>]:`

Defaults:

- Config defaults to the path LaserSell is currently using.
- Keystore defaults to `wallet.keystore.json` in the same directory as the config.

## Step 7: Review and write

LaserSell prints a summary like:

- Strategy (take profit, stop loss, deadline)
- RPC choice
- WebSocket choice
- Wallet pubkey (shortened)
- File names

### Overwrite prompts

If the target config or keystore already exists, LaserSell will ask before overwriting:

- `Config file location ... exists. Overwrite? [y/N]:`
- `Keystore file location ... exists. Overwrite? [y/N]:`

Behavior to know:

- Default is **No**.
- If you answer **No**:
  - In **custom mode**, you’ll be asked to enter a different path.
  - In **recommended mode**, the wizard will stop and tell you to rerun without recommended settings if you want different file locations.

### Final prompt: write configuration

Prompt:

- `Write configuration now?`

Defaults:

- **Recommended mode:** defaults to **Yes**
- **Custom mode:** defaults to **No** (you must type `y` to write)

If you do not write, the wizard exits without saving.

## What happens after “Setup complete”

After setup, LaserSell continues into normal startup:

- If you created/imported a wallet, it will use the encrypted keystore going forward.
- On future launches, LaserSell will require the **keystore passphrase** to unlock the wallet (unless you’ve set up an automated passphrase flow for headless runs).

## Common issues

### “config file not found; run --setup in an interactive terminal”

You’re launching LaserSell without a config **in a non-interactive environment** (no TTY). Fix:

1. SSH into the machine (or open a local terminal)
2. Run the wizard once:

   ```shellscript
   lasersell --setup
   ```
3. Then run headless/service mode using the generated config.

### My imported seed phrase gives the “wrong” wallet address

LaserSell derives using Solana’s standard derivation path (`m/44'/501'/0'/0'`) and no additional BIP-39 passphrase. If your wallet uses a different setup, import via **base58 secret key** or **keypair JSON** instead.

title: "Prerequisites Overview"

LaserSell runs fine on a desktop or laptop. A Linux VPS is optional. It is simply a common choice for users who want a more consistent environment, better uptime, and sometimes lower latency depending on where their internet and RPC are located.

This section covers the two prerequisites you will choose between.

Private RPC is **recommended**.

Linux VPS is **optional**.

## Private RPC

LaserSell relies on RPC for sending transactions, reading on chain state, and receiving real time events via WebSockets.

You can try public RPCs, but many public endpoints are rate limited and can be unreliable under load. A private RPC is recommended for smoother operation and fewer issues.

See: [Choosing a Private RPC](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/choosing-a-private-rpc)

## Linux VPS

Running LaserSell on a VPS can be useful if you want higher uptime, a more consistent environment, and possible latency improvements if the VPS is in the same region as your RPC.

A VPS is not automatically faster. If your desktop and your RPC are already close, desktop can be just as good.

See: [Setting Up the Linux VPS](https://docs.lasersell.io/start-here/setting-up-linux-vps)

## Minimum requirements

### Desktop or laptop

No special requirements beyond being able to install and run LaserSell.

### VPS

A very small VPS is sufficient.

- 1 vCPU
- 1 GB RAM
- 10 to 15 GB disk
- Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, or Debian 12 or newer

## Latency basics

Latency is mostly about distance and routing between your machine and your RPC. If you use a VPS, put it in the same region as your RPC provider for best results.

## Choose your setup

### Desktop or laptop

Pick an RPC, install LaserSell, run it locally.

### Linux VPS

Pick an RPC, create a VPS in the same region, install LaserSell on the VPS, run it 24 by 7.

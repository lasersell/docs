title: "Comparison: LaserSell vs. Standard Market Orders"
---

A common question for new users is: _"Why should I use LaserSell when I can just click 'Market Sell' on a trading website?"_

While a standard market order is sufficient for casual trading, it is mechanically distinct from the execution engine inside LaserSell. When you rely on a web interface to exit a position, you are introducing multiple layers of friction that do not exist in LaserSell's architecture.

The following breakdown compares the lifecycle of a standard market order against a LaserSell automated exit.

### 1. The Data Source (Stale vs. Live)

**Standard Market Order:**

When you look at a trading website, you are not looking at the blockchain; you are looking at a snapshot of the blockchain that was fetched by the website's API, processed by their backend, sent to your browser, and rendered on your screen. In fast-moving markets, the price you see on the UI is often already "old" news.

**LaserSell:**

LaserSell bypasses the middleman. It maintains a direct, high-speed connection to the Solana network. It receives price updates the instant they are propagated to the network, allowing it to calculate your profit and loss based on the absolute latest block data, not a delayed website refresh.

### 2. The Reaction Trigger (Human vs. Machine)

**Standard Market Order:**

Execution relies on human reflexes. You must:

1. Wait for the price to hit your target visually.
2. Mentally confirm it is time to sell.
3. Move your mouse to the button.
4. Click "Sell".
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet popup.

This process introduces seconds of latency. In volatile "PvP" rounds, seconds are often the difference between profit and loss.

**LaserSell:**

LaserSell removes the biological bottleneck. You pre-define your Take Profit and Stop Loss targets. The software evaluates every single price update against your rules. The millisecond a block arrives that satisfies your criteria, the exit transaction is constructed and signed immediately. Zero reaction time, zero hesitation.

### 3. The Propagation Path (Public vs. Priority)

**Standard Market Order:**

Most web wallets broadcast transactions through standard public channels. During periods of high network congestion, these transactions can get stuck in a queue or dropped entirely, forcing you to retry while the price continues to move against you.

**LaserSell:**

LaserSell is built for congestion. It utilizes specialized, direct transaction endpoints and automatically attaches "miner tips" (priority fees) to every trade. This effectively puts your transaction in the "fast lane," significantly increasing the probability that your exit is processed in the very next block, even when the network is clogged.

### 4. The Outcome (Reactive vs. Deterministic)

**Standard Market Order:**

A market order is a reactive panic tool. You are often chasing the price down. If you click sell after a red candle appears, you are likely selling into the bottom of that movement because the liquidity has already been taken by faster actors.

**LaserSell:**

LaserSell is a deterministic tool. Because it executes on the _same_ block that the price movement is detected, it competes for liquidity at the triggering price level, rather than reacting to it after the fact. This helps protect your exit price and adhere closer to your planned strategy.

### Summary

| **Feature**          | **Standard Web Market Order** | **LaserSell Auto-Exit**     |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Data Feed**        | API Polling (Delayed)         | Direct Stream (Real-Time)   |
| **Trigger**          | Manual Human Reaction         | Instant Algorithmic Trigger |
| **Execution**        | Click + Wallet Confirm        | Automated & Instant         |
| **Network Priority** | Standard / Low                | High Priority / Jito Tipped |

> **Core Concept:** Use a market order when you are casually entering or exiting a long-term hold. Use LaserSell when you need to execute a precise plan in a highly volatile environment where every millisecond counts.

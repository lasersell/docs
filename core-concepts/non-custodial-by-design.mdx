At LaserSell, we believe in a simple, non-negotiable truth of crypto: **Not your keys, not your coins.**

## Why We Built a Local Client

The LaserSell client runs on your machine. We did not want to build another website or app that asks you to connect your wallet and trust a third party with your keys. Instead, we built a local execution engine where your private keys are encrypted on your device, protected by a passphrase only you know, and never transmitted anywhere.

This is a deliberate design decision:

- **Your keys stay local.** The encrypted keystore lives on your machine. LaserSell never sends your private keys or seed phrases over the network.
- **Transactions are signed locally.** Trade construction and signing happen entirely on your device, then broadcast directly to the Solana network via your own RPC connection.
- **No wallet connection flow.** There is no browser popup, no "approve" button on a third-party site, and no custodial middleware between you and the blockchain.

## Encrypted Keystore, Not Plaintext

Even the standard Solana CLI tools save keypairs in plaintext by default. If malware scans your file system and finds that file, it can read your private key instantly.

LaserSell takes a different approach. When you import or generate a wallet, the keypair is encrypted locally using industry-standard encryption. Even if someone gained access to your file system, they would still need your keystore passphrase to access your funds.

## The SDK: Bringing Non-Custodial Execution to Developers

The same Exit Intelligence that powers the LaserSell client is available to developers through the [LaserSell SDK](/api/overview). The SDK provides the real-time exit strategy engine, transaction building, and multi-protocol support that the client uses internally.

This means developers building their own trading apps, bots, or platforms can integrate LaserSell's execution layer without ever needing to custody user keys. The SDK handles the strategy logic and transaction construction; signing and key management stay with whoever controls the wallet.

Available in [TypeScript](/api/sdk/typescript), [Python](/api/sdk/python), [Rust](/api/sdk/rust), and [Go](/api/sdk/go).

## Our Transparency Guarantee

- **No "Cloud" Backup:** We do not back up your keys to the cloud.
- **No Hidden Access:** Our router is a pass-through mechanism; it does not retain custody of your assets.
- **No Key Sharing:** Your keys never leave your local environment.

You are the only person who can access your funds. That is how crypto was designed to work, and that is how LaserSell is built to operate.

> **Core Concept:** LaserSell is non-custodial at every layer. The client encrypts and stores keys locally. The SDK gives developers the same execution engine without requiring key custody. Your keys, your coins.

title: "Why Local Execution Wins"
---

In the world of Solana trading, **latency is the only metric that matters.** Most automated tools operate on a centralized SaaS model. While convenient, this creates a massive performance bottleneck. LaserSell is built on a **Local Execution** model: the software runs directly on your machine or your private VPS.

Here is why running your own tooling is the ultimate competitive advantage:

### 1. Zero Resource Contention

On a centralized website, a single server might be handling WebSocket streams and trade logic for hundreds of users simultaneously. When a high-volume event occurs, that server’s CPU and memory spike, causing queuing delays.

- **The LaserSell Edge:** Your instance of LaserSell has **100% dedicated access** to your hardware. There is no line to wait in. When your trigger hits, your machine processes it instantly.

### 2. Direct-to-RPC Pipeline

Centralized platforms add an extra hop to every trade. The data must travel from the blockchain to their server, then to their UI, then back to the blockchain.

- **The LaserSell Edge:** You are the last mile. By running the Rust-based client locally, you connect your environment directly to the Solana RPC. You eliminate the middleman, shaving crucial milliseconds off every transaction.

### 3. Dedicated Network Reputation

Centralized trading sites often use shared IP addresses and shared RPC pools. If the platform gets rate-limited or throttled due to another user’s activity, your trades suffer.

- **The LaserSell Edge:** You use your own RPC connection and your own IP. This ensures your transaction propagation is never throttled by the noisy neighbors on a shared platform.

### 4. Deterministic Speed (Rust)

Web-based tools are often limited by the overhead of browser environments and interpreted languages.

- **The LaserSell Edge:** LaserSell is compiled in **Rust**, the same language Solana is built on. It is designed for low-level memory management and maximum execution speed, ensuring your Auto-TP and Auto-SL triggers are sent to the leader the microsecond the conditions are met.

> **The Verdict:** Don't outsource your edge to a shared server. Run your own tooling, control your own speed, and hit the exit while the rest of the market is still waiting for a web page to refresh.

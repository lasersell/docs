**LaserSell is not designed to replace your favorite trading terminal, wallet, or scanner.** It is built to be a specialized execution layer for your existing workflow. Whether you are a trader or a developer building your own tools, LaserSell handles the most critical part of the trade: the exit.

## Buy Anywhere, Exit with LaserSell

Most trading platforms try to be all-in-one, which often leads to performance trade-offs. LaserSell focuses exclusively on being the fastest, most reliable way to automate your sells.

- **Works with any entry method.** Execute your buys on [Axiom](https://axiom.trade/@x3n), [Photon](https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/), [BullX](https://neo.bullx.io/), [Terminal](https://trade.padre.gg/), or any other platform. LaserSell detects the position automatically and applies your exit strategy.
- **No workflow changes.** Keep watching charts on Axiom or Terminal, use [Phantom](https://phantom.com/) for manual adjustments, and let LaserSell run in the background as your automated exit layer.
- **On-chain results, visible everywhere.** When LaserSell executes a sell, the transaction appears on-chain instantly. You will see it in whatever dashboard or explorer you already use.

## Background Execution

LaserSell is designed to be heard on the blockchain, but not seen in your workflow. Once your strategy is configured, it runs passively:

- Your take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, deadline, and sell-on-graduation rules are evaluated on every price update.
- The moment a condition is met, the exit is constructed, signed, and broadcast automatically.
- No manual attention, no confirmation popups, no switching windows.

## For Deployers

For serial deployers, preparing and launching memecoins is a full-time job that makes manual trading nearly impossible. LaserSell provides a "set and forget" exit solution.

- **Focus on the launch.** If you are using [RapidLaunch](https://rapidlaunch.io/), [Uxento](https://uxento.io/), or [J7 Tracker](https://j7tracker.com/) to deploy, you are likely juggling browser windows and community channels. LaserSell handles your exit plan so you can focus on the launch.
- **Clean early exits.** Many coins do not experience significant growth until the developer supply has cleared. LaserSell allows deployers to automate this step cleanly and instantly.

## For Developers: The LaserSell SDK

The same Exit Intelligence engine that powers the LaserSell client is available as an [SDK and API](/api/overview) for developers building their own tools.

- Integrate real-time exit strategy logic into your own trading bot, platform, or dashboard.
- Full protocol coverage: Pump.fun, PumpSwap, Meteora DBC, Meteora DAMM V2, Raydium Launchpad, and Raydium CPMM.
- Available in [TypeScript](/api/sdk/typescript), [Python](/api/sdk/python), [Rust](/api/sdk/rust), and [Go](/api/sdk/go).

## Ecosystem Compatibility

LaserSell sits alongside the tools you already use:

- **Trading terminals:** Axiom, Photon, BullX, Terminal
- **Deployment tools:** RapidLaunch, Uxento, J7 Tracker
- **Charts and tracking:** Axiom, Terminal, [Dexscreener](https://dexscreener.com/)

> **Core Concept:** You do not have to change your workflow to use LaserSell. You add LaserSell to your workflow to ensure your exits are as fast and disciplined as the rest of your strategy.

title: "Escaping a Rug Pull"
description: "How LaserSell's automated exit strategies protect your bankroll when a token dumps or rugs, so you survive to trade the next setup."

In the Solana memecoin ecosystem, rug pulls and instant liquidity drains are inevitable. If you trade enough coins, you will eventually enter a project that dumps immediately.

The difference between a professional trader and a gambler is not that the professional avoids every rug. It is that the professional survives them with their bankroll intact.

## The Panic Cascade

When a coin starts to dump or a rug pull executes, the price action moves faster than human reaction time. Manual traders often freeze, leading to a psychological failure loop:

1. **Shock:** The chart turns vertical red.
2. **Hesitation:** You think maybe it is just a dip and wait for a bounce.
3. **Realization:** The liquidity is thinning out, and the loss is now deep.
4. **Paralysis:** You feel it is too late to sell, so you hold.
5. **Wipeout:** The position goes to near zero.

Every step in that sequence is time lost. LaserSell removes all five steps by acting before you have time to hesitate.

## Controlled Downside

LaserSell turns uncontrolled downside into **controlled downside** through multiple layers of automated protection:

### Stop Loss

By setting an automated stop loss, you make a pre-commitment: "I am willing to lose this much, but I refuse to lose everything." When the price hits your stop, LaserSell triggers the exit immediately. It does not hope for a bounce. It saves your capital.

A 10% loss is recoverable. A 99% loss is a blown account.

### Trailing Stop

A fixed stop loss protects against total wipeouts, but it does not help when a token pumps and then reverses. The trailing stop solves this.

It tracks the peak profit of your position. If the price reverses and drops a set percentage from that peak, LaserSell exits automatically. This means:

- On a rug that happens after a pump, you lock in some of the upside instead of riding it back to zero.
- On a slow bleed, the trailing stop tightens as profit grows, giving you better protection the higher the token goes.

### Sell on Graduation

Some tokens dump immediately after migrating from a bonding curve to a DEX (e.g. Pump.fun to PumpSwap). With sell-on-graduation enabled, LaserSell exits automatically at the moment of migration before the post-graduation dump can play out.

### Deadline Timeout

If a position goes sideways and no other exit condition fires, the deadline forces an exit after a set number of seconds. This prevents capital from being locked in a stagnant position while you could be deploying it elsewhere.

## Adjust on the Fly

Your risk tolerance may change depending on the setup. LaserSell lets you adjust settings at any time through the TUI, even while a trade is active:

```
set sl 5%
set ts 3%
set graduation on
```

- **Tighten up:** If a coin pumps, raise your stop loss to breakeven for a risk-free ride.
- **Loosen up:** If you are entering a high-volatility play, widen your stop to avoid getting wicked out by normal noise.
- **Layer protections:** Combine a stop loss, trailing stop, and deadline together. Whichever triggers first executes the exit.

## Survival is the Strategy

In a market where a single bad trade can erase a week of gains, automated downside protection is not optional. It is the foundation that every other strategy is built on.

> **Core Concept:** A rug pull is only a wipeout if you are still holding when it finishes. LaserSell's layered exit strategies (stop loss, trailing stop, sell on graduation, deadline) ensure you exit early, preserve capital, and live to trade the next setup.

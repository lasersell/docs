title: "Escaping a Rug Pull"
---

In the Solana memecoin ecosystem, rug pulls and instant liquidity drains are inevitable. If you trade enough coins, you will eventually enter a project that dumps immediately.

The difference between a professional trader and a gambler is not that the professional avoids every rug; it is that the professional survives them with their bankroll intact.

### The Panic Cascade

When a coin starts to dump or a rug pull executes, the price action moves faster than human reaction time. Manual traders often freeze, leading to a psychological failure loop known as the Panic Cascade:

1. **Shock:** The chart turns vertical red.
2. **Hesitation:** You think maybe it is just a dip and wait for a bounce.
3. **Realization:** The liquidity is thinning out, and the loss is now deep.
4. **Paralysis:** You feel it is too late to sell, so you hold.
5. **Wipeout:** The position goes to near zero.

### The Solution: Controlled Downside

LaserSell changes the fundamental equation of trading by turning uncontrolled downside into **controlled downside**.

By setting an automated Stop Loss, you are making a pre commitment to the market: "I am willing to lose this much, but I refuse to lose everything".

- **Mechanical Execution:** When the price hits your stop, LaserSell triggers the exit immediately. It does not hope for a bounce. It simply saves your capital.
- **Survival:** A 20% loss is a bad day. A 99% loss is a blown account. LaserSell ensures you live to trade the next setup.

### Flexible Protection

Your risk tolerance may change depending on the chart. LaserSell allows you to adjust your Auto-SL settings at any time, even while a trade is active.

- **Tighten Up:** If a coin pumps, you can drag your stop loss up to Breakeven to ensure a risk free ride.
- **Loosen Up:** If you are entering a high volatility play, you can widen your stop to avoid getting wicked out by normal noise.

### The "Never Go Back" Reality

Once you experience the safety of an automated shield, manual trading feels structurally unsafe. Knowing that your downside is mathematically capped allows you to trade with a clearer head and less anxiety.

> **Core Concept:** A stop loss isn't just a tool; it is survival. In a market designed to take everything, LaserSell ensures you only give up what is tolerable.

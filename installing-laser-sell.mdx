Now that your server is up to date, you can install LaserSell using our official APT repository. This ensures you can easily update the bot in the future with a simple command.

Run the following commands one by one:

**1. Add the LaserSell GPG Key** This verifies that the software you are downloading is actually created by us and hasn't been tampered with.

Bash

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lasersell.github.io/apt/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/lasersell-archive-keyring.gpg
```

**2. Add the Repository to your sources** This tells your server where to look for the LaserSell files.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/lasersell-archive-keyring.gpg] https://lasersell.github.io/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lasersell.list > /dev/null
```

**3. Update and Install** Pull the latest package lists and install the bot.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lasersell
```

**4. Verify Installation** Check that the bot is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
lasersell --version
```

You are now ready to configure your bot!
